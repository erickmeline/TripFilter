The use of llamas will facilitate our ability to realize these goals. The llamas bear the weight of supplies and equipment that otherwise limit the scope and enjoyment of a wilderness outing. Because of their natural adaptation to the areas we will be exploring, llamas can have minimal impact on the\u00a0environment. Working with the amusing llamas adds another dimension to your whole experience--EXPANDFROMHERE--.Our trip will be formulated on basic wilderness principles, but tailored to individual needs regarding distance, pace, interests, activities, and menu. You are responsible for providing personal items, such as toiletries, clothing, daypack, and waterproof camera (due to possible winds that can transport sand into your camera).We will follow low-impact techniques in all phases of our treks. We emphasize leaving the\u00a0wilderness resource in a condition that will be enjoyable for those who follow us. You will help\u00a0with food preparation, camp setup, camp maintenance, and llama care. Our menus are planned to include fresh, wholesome foods, taking into consideration as much as we can activity level, special needs, health conditions, and preferences. Activities such as day-hiking, birding, swimming, and taking photos fill the time not spent on the trail or in camp.Even though llamas lessen the physical effort required for these trips, you must prepare by\u00a0increasing your physical conditioning prior to the trip in anticipation of altitude, temperature\u00a0extremes, moisture, and unfamiliar exercise.

An arrowhead dated to 12,000 years ago was found near Lipan point a few years ago. Pictographs, petroglyphs, cliff dwellings, granaries, foundation ruins, split twig figures, arrowheads, spear points, and potsherds are sprinkled throughout the region. These and other archaeological artifacts are testament to the rich human history in the area. These early peoples grew corn, beans, and squash and hunted bighorn sheep, deer, and small animals and birds to survive. By 1,250 CE most had left the area, almost all at once, for reasons that are not completely understood but might have involved drought, overpopulation, disease, warfare, or a combination of these and perhaps other factors. By the time Coronado explored the area in the 16th century, some regions of Arizona were virtually depopulated--EXPANDFROMHERE--.\u00a0Our journey will take us through a variety of canyons rich with pictographs and some other archaeological treasures. Some of the rock art we will see may date back as far as 5,000 BCE. Much of it is considered Basketmaker era rock art with its own distinctive Esplanade style. Our route is spectacularly beautiful with vast sweeping vistas across the Esplanade, which is a broad rock layer at the top of the Supai at roughly 4,500 feet in elevation. We will also hike into narrow intimate canyons, some with springs and lush riparian habitats. The Kanab Creek Wilderness, where most of our journey takes place, consists of over 68,000 acres and was designated by Congress in 1984. It is on North Kaibab National Forest and BLM lands. Our route will take us to the northern border of Grand Canyon National Park, which is contiguous with Kanab Creek Wilderness and only about seven air miles from the Colorado River.\u00a0","highlights":"View many mysterious examples of prehistoric rock art, Experience a wild and seldom-visited wilderness, Enjoy stunning views of endless canyons","includes":"  Good camaraderie and adventure,   All meals and cooking equipment,   Expert guidance and permits","itinerary":"Note: The following is purposely vague to protect the archaeology of the area.Day 1: Meeting early, we will do a vehicle shuttle. Driving rough dirt roads that require high-clearance vehicles, we will need about 1.5 hours to get to the Jumpup trailhead, where we end our trip. After leaving some of our vehicles there, we will drive the remaining vehicles about one hour to the Snake Gulch trailhead, where we begin our trip. Today we hike on a good and mostly level trail in a lovely open valley bordered by red sandstone canyon walls. We will see several rock art panels as we hike today. Our mileage is about 7.5 miles with about 900 feet of descent.Day 2: Today we continue our sojourn in Snake Gulch with good trail and with a gradual descent. Some pioneer traces will be evident today. The canyon walls grow higher and we may take some time to explore side canyons and look for springs. Our camp tonight will be dry, requiring us to carry about six quarts of water. Our mileage today is almost 10 miles with a 1,200-foot descent.Day 3: The confluence of Snake Gulch and Kanab Creek will come upon us soon today.\u00a0Once we turn to the south following Kanab Creek, the hiking becomes a little more arduous as the trail periodically disappears altogether for long distances. Arroyos and small side canyons will have to be negotiated all day. Some fine pictographs and more pioneer traces will be in evidence today. Our mileage today is about 10 miles with an ascent of 1,300 feet and a descent of 1,700 feet.Day 4: A good trail will appear again today and the hiking will be easier, but there will be a number of side canyons we will hike around. Time permitting, we will drop our packs and take some time to explore one or two of these side canyons to look for more rock art panels. Much of the hiking today is on the Esplanade with spectacular views. Toward the end of the day we will descend a few hundred feet into the bed of Kanab Creek. Our mileage today is a little less than 11 miles with an ascent of 1,300 feet and a descent of 1,700 feet.Day 5: A long lovely hike up a side canyon, without packs, to see excellent rock art panels will form the main part of our journey today. We will start to see redwall limestone cliffs form as we continue down canyon. We have left the Esplanade behind and are now deep within narrow canyons. Our mileage today is about 10 miles with an ascent of 1,200 feet and a descent of 1,400 feet.Day 6: The top of the redwall, which forms a bench in this area, will be our hiking platform for most of the day until we come to a lush narrow side canyon. Hiking up this canyon, an oasis in this dry area, we will eventually return to the Esplanade and camp for the night. Some unique rock art and some other archaeological artifacts will be a treat today. Our mileage today is about 10 miles with an ascent of 1,400 feet and a descent of 300 feet.Day 7: Continuing along the Esplanade, we will pick up a good trail early in the day. We will do a couple of side hikes today to enjoy some fine rock art panels, a little different than what we have seen on the rest of the trip. We will have one steep descent of several hundred feet into a side canyon today and then an ascent several hundred feet up the other side. Our last camp will be below a rock art panel on the Esplanade. Our mileage today is about 10 miles (including the side hikes) with an ascent of 1,400 feet and a descent of 1,900 feet.Day 8: Our last hike will be up a wash that narrows and becomes increasingly lush as we ascend. One last rock art panel high on a wall will be our last pictograph of the trip. After arriving at our vehicles mid-morning at Jumpup trailhead, we will load up and retrieve the vehicles at Snake Gulch trailhead. We will caravan back and eat a well-deserved hearty lunch. Our mileage today is 5.5 miles with an ascent of 1,400 feet and a negligible descent.","leader1":"Barry Morenz","leader2":"Daniel Pettit","leader3":"Mark Holcomb"}},{"trip":{"title":"Women's Backpacking Paria Canyon: A Week of Visual Surprises, Arizona and Utah","id":"18034B","dates":"Apr 7, 2018 to Apr 13, 2018","destination":"United States, Utah","type":"Backpack","group":"Women","difficulty":"3 (out of 5)","priceHigh":"1195","priceLow":"1195","image":{"src":"https:\/\/content.sierraclub.org\/outings\/sites\/content.sierraclub.org.outings\/files\/styles\/trip-teaser\/public\/trips\/main-images\/18034_1_TeresaRounds_0.jpg?itok=Rse20BDM","alt":"Women's Backpacking Paria Canyon: A Week of Visual Surprises, Arizona and Utah"},"path":"\/outings\/womens-backpacking-paria-canyon-arizona-utah#trip=18034B","overview":"The TripThe Paria River Canyon provides an intimate experience of quintessential Colorado Plateau country.

Passing by or under Slide Rock Arch will be one of the many highlights of the day. We will hike about eight miles today to camp near the confluence of the Paria River and Buckskin Gulch, the narrowest section of the Paria.Day 2: In the morning we will take a side hike to explore the tall Navajo Sandstone walls of Buckskin Gulch, as far as the Boulder Jam, about 1.5 miles up Buckskin. In the afternoon, we will hike about 4.5 miles down-canyon into Arizona to camp at Big Spring.Day 3: During our seven-mile backpack today, we continue to follow the tight meanders of the canyon, taking time to explore abandoned meanders, a delicate water-formed cave, and remnants from a time when ranchers hoped to graze cattle in the area. We\u2019ll camp near a spring that emerges from a cathedral-like alcove.Day 4: Today we will cover only about three miles of the canyon, but take much of the morning to hike to Wrather Arch -- spanning nearly 200 feet, the\u00a0soaring formation has\u00a0the claim of being one of the most inaccessible arches in the U.S. After lunch we\u2019ll take a side walk to see a spectacular petroglyph panel, and camp near lush Shower Spring.Day 5: We will continue downstream about seven miles today, passing an enormous hanging sand dune spilling into the canyon, and stopping to see several petroglyph panels. The canyon begins to widen and we begin to see new geological layers, the Kayenta, Moenave, and Chinle Formations. In the afternoon, we will start walking well above the river and get a new perspective of Paria Canyon.

Cobb, Arizona Highways Magazine, 1940.Early in the 20th century, the well-known Southwestern desert guide John Wetherill led various adventurers -- including author Zane Grey, clothing manufacturer Charles Bernheimer, and former president Teddy Roosevelt -- through Cobb's \"disordered conglomeration\" on the way to Rainbow Bridge. Zane Grey later described the route as having the most dangerous slopes he had ever seen. Roosevelt described tilted masses of sheet-rock ending in cliffs and difficult for both horses and men. Bernheimer, describing the route as \"fiendish,\" wrote to his wife that there was nothing like it anywhere else.We, too, will hike to Rainbow Bridge and walk in the shadow of Navajo Mountain, but we won\u2019t follow John Wetherill\u2019s route. That route, known as the Rainbow Trail, is today traveled by several hundred hikers every year. Our route is followed by no one, except us. In comparison, our route will make Wetherill's look as flat as Kansas. The trip will begin in Rainbow City on the east flank of Navajo Mountain. After starting on Wetherill's now well-worn route, we will leave that route for the maze of cracks and slot canyons identified on early maps as Mystery Canyon. From this point on, our route runs cross-country through a tortuous landscape that to this day has known very few non-native visitors.Mystery Canyon is well protected from casual hikers. Its Colorado River terminus is a long blank wall and at the upper end, the canyon's three branches embrace a nearly 2,000-foot-high sandstone battlement. All three branches are narrow, vertical slots with no easy, or easily found, routes in or out.Our hike will take us into all three branches. All are relatively short and -- were it not for the pour-offs, plunge pools, ledges, cliffs and, in some places, nearly impenetrable vegetation -- a motivated hiker could walk the length of each branch in a day. But the obstacles make this impossible without technical canyoneering skills and very nearly impossible even with them. We will backpack across the three branches of the canyon and day-hike in each of the branches where we can safely do so. We will see Anasazi ruins, moqui steps, pictographs, petroglyphs, a cave, dinosaur fossils, miles of slickrock, and more vertical landscape per square yard than perhaps anywhere in the Southwest.Our last day begins with a short hike to Echo Camp -- now just a few rusting bed frames and disintegrating wood shacks, but graced with a lovely spring and a shallow pool surrounded by maidenhair fern. Soon thereafter, we reach Rainbow Bridge, the destination for John Wetherill\u2019s trips and the highest and longest natural stone bridge on the planet. The trip ends with a leisurely boat ride across Lake Powell back to Page.This eight-day hike will begin in Rainbow City on the shoulder of Navajo Mountain. Our Navajo friends will provide transport (not part of the Sierra Club trip) from Page, Arizona to our trailhead. The leader will provide detailed information regarding the meeting location, time, and the Navajo transport. The transport cost is approximately $75. Because the transport is not part of the Sierra Club trip, the cost is not included in the trip fee.\u00a0","highlights":"Hike almost exclusively on Navajo land, Visit remote, rarely accessed desert wilderness, Discover Anasazi ruins, prehistoric pictographs, fossil","includes":"  All meals, commissary, and group equipment,   Boat ride from Rainbow Bridge to Wahweap Marina,   Permits","itinerary":"Day 1:\u00a0We will backpack about five miles, crossing Bald Rock and Cha Canyons, and camping in a large alcove with evidence of ancient habitation in Nasja Canyon.Day 2:\u00a0We descend a canyon named for the Paiute Indian (Nasja) who originally guided John Wetherill to Rainbow Bridge. After an optional side trip through a slot with shallow water, we climb steeply out of the canyon, crossing to the upper end of Mystery Canyon, where we will spend the night. Although our campsite is only about a half-mile from the previous night's campsite, we will need nearly the entire day to get there.Days 3-4:\u00a0We backpack to the other two branches of Mystery Canyon, camping and day hiking in the canyons.Days 5-6:\u00a0We backpack out of Mystery Canyon to Oak Canyon and take a side trip to an overlook. We will day hike on the sixth day to a high butte with 200-mile views (if the weather is clear); we may also find dinosaur fossils and explore a cave with pictographs.Days 7-8:\u00a0We rejoin Wetherill's route, backpacking about half the seventh day to the upper end of Bridge Canyon. On the eighth day, we hike down Bridge Canyon via Echo Camp to Rainbow Bridge. Rainbow Bridge National Monument is the world's largest known natural bridge. From there we will take a two-hour boat ride across Lake Powell back to Page.Except for the brief visit to Rainbow Bridge, this trip is entirely on land within the Navajo Nation. We will enjoy the area as guests of the local Navajo, and the Sierra Club will make a donation to the Navajo Mountain chapter house or school to express our appreciation.The rugged nature of the landscape makes this trip more than an introduction to hiking the Colorado Plateau -- rather it is a mini-expedition through a rarely visited desert wilderness. Once we leave the Rainbow Trail, participants are committed to the entire trip. Other than by helicopter, leaving early is impossible.

Between the blue, forested volcanic cone of Navajo Mountain and the town of Page, Arizona lies a high desert wilderness as unvisited and remote as can be found anywhere. Called the Rainbow Plateau, this small corner of our planet is protected by its extraordinary difficulty of access. Bordered on the north by Lake Powell and the south by Navajo Canyon, the Plateau isn't penetrated by any roads (no paved road comes even close). Except for a few no-longer-used Navajo sheep trails, there aren't even footpaths--EXPANDFROMHERE--. Home to Navajo sheepherding families in the early-20th century, the area today is rarely visited even by the Navajo, and almost never by non-Navajo tourist hikers and backpackers. For those who lust for waking up in the middle of nowhere, without the flies and mosquitoes of the great white north, there is no better place.A labyrinth of twisting canyons, sandstone domes, and high buttes and monuments, the Rainbow Plateau is a feast of scenic magnificence. On this trip \"Somewhere Over the Rainbow,\" we will experience canyons that are narrow, dark, and cold in some places, and sunny and warm in other places, with streams bordered by cottonwood and willow.\u00a0We will hike through domelands of red Navajo sandstone with cross-bedded slickrock and unexpected dropoffs, and enjoy panoramic views while exploring high mesas close to the original surface of the Colorado Plateau. On one day we will wade and swim with all our gear up a spectacular slot canyon.\u00a0Every day will test our navigational skill as we find our way through a tangled maze of fractured and eroded sandstone. While we may sometimes find and use old Navajo sheep trails, our route is entirely cross-country, and we will not follow any maintained hiking trails for the simple reason that there are none.The hike will explore several major canyons, including Sand Canyon and West Canyon. We will discover and cross a large natural bridge, find pictographs and other archaeological sites, and climb to the base of Octagon Butte and perhaps to the top of Cummings Mesa. The interests and capability of the group, along with the weather, will determine the precise route of the hike. The rugged nature of the terrain through which we will travel makes this trip more than an introduction to hiking the Colorado Plateau. Rather, it is a mini-expedition through a rarely visited desert wilderness. Once we leave Page, participants are committed to the entire trip. Other than by helicopter, leaving is essentially impossible.","highlights":"Follow a unique, trailless route in a desert wilderness, Explore remote slot canyons, Discover prehistoric pictographs and petroglyphs","includes":"  All meals and group cooking equipment,   Permits and a donation to local Navajo chapter house,   Meeting with local Navajo friends of the leader team","itinerary":"This eight-day loop hike will begin and end at the home of a Navajo friend and his family -- one of two families living on the edge of the Rainbow Plateau. Because the route between Page and the Rainbow Plateau includes a difficult 4WD track that requires local knowledge, participants are encouraged to use transport services provided by local Navajo friends (transportation is not part of the Sierra Club trip).Day 1:\u00a0Starting at the confluence of creeks close to our friend's home, we will backpack 8-10 miles down a major canyon to our campsite.

We will explore canyons and hidden pools, and see pictographs and long-abandoned hogans. We will experience the fine details that are unique to the desert in springtime, from freshly leaved cottonwoods to the various cacti in bloom.Days 5-8:\u00a0We will have one layover day to explore West Canyon, described by Michael Kelsey as the \"premier\" slot canyon on the Colorado Plateau. We will navigate the middle and possibly the upper narrows if time allows by wading and swimming through the narrow passages. On the last day, we climb the slickrock above the head of West Canyon to the base of Octagon Butte, then descend from there to Jayi Canyon, where we meet our Navajo friends for transport back to Page.Transport between Page and the Rainbow Plateau will be provided by local Navajo and is not part of the Sierra Club trip. Information on these services will be provided. The cost of these services, about $70 per person, will be paid directly to the Navajo and is not included in the trip price.The trip is entirely on land within the Navajo Nation and through an area normally closed to non-Navajo visitors (as is most of the Navajo Nation).

I have heard it said that an inoculation to the sights and smells of the Carolina Low Country is an almost irreversible antidote to the charms of other landscapes, other alien geographies. You can be moved profoundly by other vistas, by other oceans, by soaring mountain ranges, but you can never be seduced. You can even forsake the Low Country, renounce it for other climates, but you can never completely escape the sensuous, semitropical pull of Charleston and her marshes.\"\u00a0- Pat ConroyCoastal South Carolina was designed -- not by man, but by Mother Nature -- for paddling. Known as \u201cThe Low Country,\u201d there is truly no other place like it. It is a one-of-a-kind combination of magnificent sweeping landscapes that shift with the tides and living history--EXPANDFROMHERE--. The unique landscape of South Carolina\u2019s Low Country is characterized by tidal salt marshes filled with spartina grass and migratory birds feeding at low tide, numerous tidal creeks, and both intracoastal and coastal waterways teeming with shrimp, oysters, crabs, dolphins, and a wide variety of fish. More than 50 percent of the South Carolina Coast is protected in one form or another. Vast stretches of undeveloped beach, estuaries, and saltwater and freshwater marshes have been protected as national seashores, national wildlife refuges, state parks, and other wilderness preserves. These vast undeveloped tracts that characterize the coastal plain provide vital habitat for an amazing diversity of wildlife.We will spend an entire week immersing ourselves in the varied and unique waterways and landscapes of the Low Country. As we kayak through narrow and winding blackwater rivers and creeks lined with Spanish-moss-draped live oaks, we will see numerous songbirds flying through through the air. We\u2019ll paddle through pristine marshes lined with spartina grass and hike part of the \u201cPalmetto Trail,\u201d which crosses the entire state of South Carolina. We\u2019ll catch the ferry out to Capers Island, exploring the secluded beaches and trails, and observing numerous migratory birds while exploring this undeveloped barrier island. We\u2019ll be staying near one of the most historic cities in the entire United States, where American history comes to life right before your eyes. You can start or end each day with a walk or run on the beach, which will be just outside the door of our oceanfront lodging. Whether casting a fishing line, searching for dolphins in the mighty Atlantic, combing the beach for seashells, swimming, walking, biking, or just relaxing and reading, the beach offers numerous ways for enjoyment.Located along the Atlantic Flyway, The Carolinas\u2019 coastal plain is the year-round or part-time home to more than 400 species of birds. Many of these can be found on Cape Romain National Wildlife Refuge, which also has the largest nesting population of loggerhead sea turtles outside the state of Florida. Currently, the refuge is actively working to aid the recovery of this threatened sea turtle. Bull Island, located within the refuge, has played an important role in the recovery of the endangered red wolf. Established in 1932, Cape Romain NWR is a generous spread of coastal waterways, sandy beaches, and maritime forests. Cape Romain covers 22 heavenly miles of South Carolina coastline, totaling nearly 66,000 acres, of which 30,000 are designated wilderness. Dolphins breaking the water\u2019s surface in Bulls Bay are a common sight.\u00a0Flying overhead are brown pelicans, laughing gulls, royal terns, osprey, and numerous other bird species. Because the refuge is only accessible by boat, crowds are never a problem. Adjoining Cape Romain NWR is the 258,000-acre Francis Marion National Forest, established in 1936. Much of the coastal area between the Santee River and the Charleston urban area is included in this forest, named for General Francis Marion, who gave the British so much trouble during the Revolutionary War because of his intimate knowledge of the South Carolina terrain. Several endangered and threatened animal and plant species make their homes in the forest, while nearly 120 miles of recreational trails are available for paddling, hiking, horseback riding, and biking. Just south of Cape Romain lies Capers Island, a state-owned barrier island that is preserved and undeveloped.The area known as the Low Country is rich in the history of South Carolina. Sewee Indians inhabited the area before the arrival of the first European settlers. English colonists made landings along the coast to resupply their ships and eventually established the first European settlement in South Carolina on the banks of the Ashley River in 1670, at the present day location of the city of Charleston. The islands and creeks within Cape Romain were once hideouts for pirates that plundered ships along the coast. Legend has it that the pirates buried part of their treasure for safekeeping in the deserted dunes and woods of the area, although none has been found so far. British warships used Bull Island, within Cape Romain, as a resupply point during the Revolutionary War. General Francis Marion used the inland swamps and forest as his base of operations and conducted a very effective guerilla warfare campaign against the British, earning him the nickname \u201cThe Swamp Fox\u201d and turning him into an American Legend. Rice plantations, fueled by slave labor, dominated the area for a period of time. The American Civil War began on April 12, 1861 as Confederate Artillery opened fire on Union-occupied Fort Sumter. The Union troops within the fort surrendered 34 hours later and it would be four years before the fort was back in Union hands. Confederate blockade runners used the tidal creeks and coastal bays of the area to elude Union ships throughout the Civil War. The area between Sullivans Island and the Isle of Palms was the point of departure for the Confederate\u00a0CSS\u00a0Hunley, the first submarine to sink an enemy vessel. After sinking the USS Housatonic, the Hunley and her crew were lost at sea. Amazingly, the wreck of the Hunley was recently discovered offshore of Sullivans Island, and is being carefully restored at the nearby Charleston shipyard.Whether you enjoy history, nature and bird watching, the ocean and beach, or paddling, the Low Country offers something for everyone.\u00a0","highlights":"Kayak the unique waterways of coastal South Carolina, Enjoy a day trip to Francis Beidler Audubon Sanctuary, Witness spring bird migration and diverse wildlife","includes":"  Daily van transportation\/airport pick up and drop off,   Six nights lodging in an oceanfront beach house,   Kayak, paddle, and life jacket rental, most meals","itinerary":"Day 1:\u00a0We will meet at our lodging at 4 p.m.\u00a0We will provide airport pick up at the United Airlines pick-up area at\u00a0Charleston, South Carolina International Airport (CHS) at 3 p.m. For those driving, the trip leader will give directions to the lodging.\u00a0We will give room assignments, make introductions, go over the itinerary for the week, and enjoy a huge welcome dinner featuring local cuisine.

We\u2019ll jump into our kayaks and paddle out on the blackwater of Wadboo Creek. We\u2019ll kayak past 25-foot-high limestone bluffs and caves as we meander through the tributaries of Wadboo Swamp, where Francis Marion once had supply shacks and resided. As we will see throughout the week, spring bird migration and other wildlife abound. If folks are up for it after dinner,\u00a0we can either do a short sunset kayak trip or take a walk on the nearby\u00a0Ravennel Bridge, which is lit up at night and amazing to see.Day 3:\u00a0Today we head north and visit the Sewee Visitor Center, where exhibits showcase the valuable ecosystems of the Cape Romain National Wildlife Refuge and Francis Marion National Forest. Next, we\u2019ll paddle Wambaw Creek, located within the heart of Francis Marion National Forest. Wambaw is a blackwater creek that offers one of the most enchanting paddles in the entire Charleston area. Time permitting, we\u2019ll explore historic Hampton Plantation, which dates back to 1735.\u00a0Day 4:\u00a0Today we\u2019ll explore the National Audubon Society\u2019s Francis Beidler Forest. Here, 1,000-year-old trees and native wildlife abound in a pristine 16,000-acre sanctuary that has been untouched for centuries. An Audubon naturalist will join us as we hike the two-mile boardwalk trail, and then kayak among giant bald cypress and tupelo gum trees in Four Holes Swamp. Four Holes Swamp is a natural swamp, and water levels are high enough at only select times of the year to paddle this amazing area. On many outings, today would be a highlight day. In the Low Country, it is just one of the many highlight days.Day 5:\u00a0Today, we will head back to Francis Marion National Forest to paddle Awendaw Creek, and hike\u00a0part of the Palmetto Trail. Awendaw Creek is tidal and travels oceanward, meandering through salt marsh and oyster banks. We can search for dolphins and other coastal wildlife, as we paddle past diverse landscapes of both bluffs covered with live oak and palmetto trees, and vistas of open water on the Intracoastal Waterway. The Palmetto Trail connects the South Carolina mountains to the sea, and will be over 500 miles in length when completed. We will hike a short part of the coastal terminus of what many call the most beautiful part of the trail.\u00a0We'll end the day with dinner at one of our favorite, unique local restaurants, where local shrimp, oysters, and other seafood will be among the variety of menu items.Day 6:\u00a0We\u2019ll start off the day with a ferry ride to Capers Island, where we\u2019ll explore the island with a local naturalist. Capers Island is an undeveloped barrier island that is owned by the state of South Carolina and only accessible by boat. One of the most fascinating features of the island is its \u201cboneyard beach.\u201d This name is due to the old tree skeletons and stumps left as a result of erosion and bleached out by the sun.\u00a0Next, we'll head to the ACE Basin to kayak one of its many waterways.\u00a0ACE is an acronym for the three major rivers that are within the basin, the Ashepoo, Edisto, and Combahee Rivers.\u00a0The ACE Basin as a unique partnership between different levels of government, Ducks Unlimited, and private landowners,\u00a0and protects over 217,000 acres of South Carolina's Coastal Plain.Day 7:\u00a0Today, we\u2019ll have breakfast, pack up, and say goodbye to new friends after enjoying an amazing week of paddling and exploring coastal South Carolina.

We will ascend from the river to Horseshoe Mesa, a camp many may vote as their favorite. As time and energy allows, we will set up camp and then roam to the end of one arm of the mesa for beautiful views of the Inner Gorge. Since there is no water on Horseshoe Mesa, our lightened packs will again be heavy as we carry all water we need for dinner and for our final exit from the canyon.

However, mid-week in April we will avoid most the crowds and witness the wild flowers of springtime in this gorgeous playground for people of all ages. Watch carefully and you might see ravens soaring like sailplanes, as these intelligent birds play in air currents along the canyon walls. But it hasn\u2019t always been a place just to come and play. In the past 6,000 years, when hunters and gatherers first entered the area, it has also been a place where people have come to make a living and raise their families. As we hike through wilderness into canyons and onto mesas, we will also take a walk through history. In the evenings, there will be discussions of man\u2019s historical relationship with nature, including environmental factors that may be relevant to the fall of the Sinagua civilization.","highlights":"Stay in a beautiful Sedona home with pool and spa, Explore lovely red rock distinctions around Sedona, Visit prehistoric Montezuma Castle and Well","includes":"  All food and lodging,   Transportation to and from the Phoenix airport,   Entrance fees ","itinerary":"Day 1:\u00a0You will be picked up at the Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport and transported to our accommodations in Sedona, Arizona.

You will have the option of either hiking a very steep route up Cathedral Rock or stay with the group electing to stay at the bottom. We will then be on our way to Montezuma Castle, the ancient Sinaqua\u2019s stunning work of architecture built after 1100 A.D. If time allows, we will visit Montezuma\u2019s Well, which reveals the incredible technology behind the Sinaqua\u2019s watering of crops.Day 3: Plans are to hike Boynton Canyon (6 miles round-trip, 700 feet of elevation gain). This trail travels through a forested canyon with views of high red- and buff-colored cliffs. Pueblo-building Sinaquas arrived in the first millennia to build cliff dwellings that are still visible. In the afternoon we will travel to Jerome, located half-way up Mingus Mountain, which is a turn-of-the-20th-century copper mining boom town that later became a ghost town.

Garlic mustard is originally from Europe and parts of Asia. The first recorded observation dates back to 1868 on Long Island, New York.\u00a0 It may have been introduced into the United States by settlers as a medicinal plant and food.\u00a0Researchers have found that garlic mustard releases chemicals that hinder the growth of other plants, including trees. In its native area, there are insects that eat it to keep it in check. In the United States, the majority of those insects are not found, so this invasive weed eventually takes over the native flora. Herbivores are dependent on native plants as a food source. Several butterfly species lay eggs on the plant. The larvae eventually die since the foliage is poisonous to them. During our time seeking and removing this plant from the landscape, the accompanying park ranger\/naturalist will provide additional information about its hazards to the surrounding ecosystem.A secondary project most likely will occur within the cave.\u00a0 In years past, foreign material, like cement and cable, have been removed.

Beginning in southern Utah, Kanab Creek and its numerous named and unnamed side canyons have cut a network of complex canyons deep into the Kanab and Kaibab Plateaus. Numerous springs and the appearing and disappearing Kanab Creek (it goes underground) provide sustenance for a variety of plant and animal life.The canyon is home to desert bighorn sheep and peregrine falcon (endangered species).\u00a0While it is unlikely we will see them, black bear and mountain lions live in the higher elevations. The white-tailed Grand Canyon squirrel, which we may see, is an interesting twist in evolution that we may talk about.Elevations range from 2,000 feet in the area of Kanab Creek, where we will be, to higher than 6,000 feet on the rim, where we will begin our hike. It may be the desert, but snow falls in winter at the higher elevations.While grazing is allowed in most wilderness areas, the grazing allotments in the area where we will be hiking are owned by a subsidiary of the Grand Canyon Trust (a sister conservation organization). As such, with forest service approval, they have focused on a restoration of the land and a renewal strategy, so it is unlikely we will see any cows in the wilderness area.","highlights":"Explore Kanab Creek Wilderness Area and side canyons, Hike through beautiful redwall narrows, Camp huge Esplanade terraces with dramatic panoramics","includes":"  Great camaraderie and adventure,   All meals and cooking equipment,   Permits and expert guidance on trails","itinerary":"The itinerary requires flexibility due to issues regarding terrain conditions, weather, etc. Obviously, participant safety will be the first priority.Day 1:\u00a0We are currently planning to meet in Fredonia, Arizona on Saturday. You need to have a sack lunch (or have already eaten lunch) and have personal snacks and drinks for the ride out to the trailhead as the first Sierra Club meal will be dinner that night. Please have most of your personal water bottles filled. Our camp for the night is located near our trailhead at Sowats Point and situated a little over 6,000 feet above sea level.Day 2:\u00a0Today we start our backpack by first driving about 20 minutes to the trailhead. We then hoist backpacks and head down to the top of Kwagunt Hollow at the Esplanade level (a little under 2 miles and 1,500 feet), and hike down Kwagunt to Jumpup Canyon (2 miles). We then head up Jumpup to water (2.5 miles) and camp on the north side of Jumpup on the Esplanade (roughly a mile north).\u00a0 Expansive canyon views will enliven our evening.Day 3:\u00a0We continue to hike north on the Esplanade Trail for roughly 7 miles to reach another high camp on the slickrock.\u00a0 Hopefully, we will find water potholes for our drinking and meal needs.Day 4:\u00a0Today we explore two side canyons of Kanab Creek. First, we continue along the Esplanade then drop down the Lawsen Trail to Kanab Creek (2.5 miles). After hiking down Kanab Creek 4 miles, we turn up Chamberlain Canyon for a little over a mile to an exit that takes us back onto the Esplanade.\u00a0 A short hike takes us to another huge Esplanade camp.Day 5:\u00a0We continue on the Esplanade to Flip-off Canyon (not named on the maps), which is roughly 1.3 miles, and then head down Flip-off to Kanab Creek (1.5 miles).\u00a0 Once in the creek bed, we hike down 2-3 miles to good water where we will camp for the night.Day 6:\u00a0We continue down Kanab Creek to the mouth of Jump-up canyon (a mile or so), and hike 3.5 miles up Jump-up to the mouth of Kwagunt through the finest Redwall canyons of Grand Canyon. We will use a route along the top of the Redwall to get into Indian Hollow (roughly 1.5 miles).\u00a0 Views down Jump-up are amazing along this high route.\u00a0 Once in Indian Hollow, we will explore our way up to another camp.Day 7:\u00a0This is a layover day. Those who are ambitious can hike to Racetrack Knoll (crossing into Grand Canyon National Park) for enormous, unobstructed views. Another option is to explore some of the many side canyons of Indian Hollow. Another great option is just lounging in camp or by a pool of water.Day 8:\u00a0With an early start, we hike back over the Esplanade and then over to the trail we came down a week earlier.\u00a0 From there, we ascend to our vehicles (1.5 miles). We should arrive back at our vehicles before noon.","leader1":"Bert Fingerhut","leader2":"Michael Wise","leader3":""}},{"trip":{"title":"Backpacking Paria Canyon: A Week of Visual Surprises, Arizona and Utah","id":"18036A","dates":"Apr 29, 2018 to May 5, 2018","destination":"United States, Arizona","type":"Backpack","group":"","difficulty":"3 (out of 5)","priceHigh":"1245","priceLow":"1245","image":{"src":"https:\/\/content.sierraclub.org\/outings\/sites\/content.sierraclub.org.outings\/files\/styles\/trip-teaser\/public\/trips\/main-images\/18036_2_Richard%20Szafarz.jpg?itok=da3DKU2Y","alt":"Backpacking Paria Canyon: A Week of Visual Surprises, Arizona and Utah"},"path":"\/outings\/backpacking-paria-canyon-arizona-utah#trip=18036A","overview":"The TripA backpack trip down the Paria River Canyon should be on everyone's list of things to do. The Paria is not a vast canyon like the Grand Canyon, but instead is intimate and has a gentle subtlety in its beauty. The tall deep-red sandstone walls, finely sculpted by the ages, offer visual displays unlike any most have ever encountered. Travelling for a week down this canyon is an experience to savor for a long time.The Paria Canyon Wilderness begins in southern Utah and follows the Paria River for 38 miles to its confluence with the Colorado River at Lee\u2019s Ferry in Arizona. In those 38 miles, we will see the canyon begin shallow and wide. Then it will narrow, with its walls rising hundreds of feet over the river. At its narrowest, the Paria River converges with Buckskin Gulch, which is considered to be one of the Colorado Plateau's most famous and beautiful slot canyons--EXPANDFROMHERE--. Toward the end of the trip, the canyon will widen again although it will remain deep, unlike the beginning. During our week\u2019s backpack, we will view ancient petroglyphs and beautiful geological forms, drink from natural springs that seemingly appear from nowhere, and explore a large natural arch on a layover day.Spring is a great time of year for this backpacking journey. The days are warm and the nights are cool. We should see spring colors and a variety of wildflowers.","highlights":"Hike the Southwest's premier slot canyon, Photograph intricate and colorful rock formations, Enjoy a layover day to explore without a full pack","includes":"  Tasty and hearty backcountry meals,   All required permits, group commissary and cooking gear","itinerary":"The following itinerary is subject to the conditions of the Paria Canyon. In particular, if water levels are high, we may move more slowly and may even have to stall to allow water levels to decline.Day 1: We will meet at Marble Canyon Lodge at 7:00 a.m., where the leaders will stay the night before the trip. We will caravan to set up a vehicle shuttle, leaving some cars at Lee\u2019s Ferry, our exit point, and then drive to our beginning point at White House. After a brief trailhead talk, we will load the group commissary bags into our backpacks and begin our hike down the Paria. Today we hope to cover 8-10 miles so that the next day will provide ample time for exploring Buckskin Gulch and the narrowest section of the Paria. We will start the day in white layers of Carmel Formation and then quickly descend into the rich reds of Navajo Sandstone.\u00a0 Passing by or under Slide Rock Arch will be one of the many highlights of the day--EXPANDFROMHERE--.Day 2: Today, we will amble back upstream to admire and photograph the tall Navajo Sandstone walls of the Paria Canyon and Buckskin Gulch, as far as the Boulder Jam, which is a wall of boulders about 1.5 miles up Buckskin from its confluence with the Paria. Past participants have taken hundreds of photographs in this section alone.\u00a0 In the afternoon, we will move our camp down-canyon a couple of miles to a lovely sandy bench.Day 3: During our 6-8 mile backpack today, we will take time to explore abandoned meanders, a delicate water-formed cave, and remnants from a past time when ranchers hoped to graze cattle in the area.Day 4: Today is a layover day and there is much in store! We will first climb to Wrather Arch, an arch spanning nearly 200 feet and having the claim of being one of the most inaccessible arches in the U.S.\u00a0 Seeing this arch alone is a treat for one day, but those interested will investigate some remote petroglyphs and an ancient route.Day 5: Today we backpack downstream, passing a cacophony of singing frogs at Shower Spring, an enormous sand pile, and numerous panels of petroglyphs, not to mention the beautiful Paria Canyon itself. Halfway through the day, we begin to see new geological layers, including the Kayenta, Moenave, and Chinle Formations. We will cover about seven miles with backpacks.Day 6: We continue our way downstream, passing petroglyphs in places and orientations one would never expect. Our hiking day covers just seven miles, but we will take most of the day due to the distractions along the way. In camp, we likely will be entertained by collared lizards.Day 7: We have just four miles to backpack to the end of the Paria where it meets with the Mighty Colorado River at Lee\u2019s Ferry. In these four miles, we will see the Moenkopi Formation rise, the Paria Canyon widen, and the Echo Cliffs beckon us to our end point. We will probably be out before noon and will then retrieve our cars from our starting point.

Kinabalu and some new colorful birds, like the black-sided flowerpecker or the beautiful short-tailed green magpie. After breakfast we continue overland toward Poring Hot Springs, stopping to walk three miles on jungle trails to access treetop canopy walkways more than one hundred feet above the forest floor. If we are lucky, we may see the streaky-breasted spiderhunter. We also may find the flowering Raffelesia, or \"corpse flower,\" that can have a blossom more than three feet in diameter! In the late afternoon we transfer overland to Sandakan in our private bus to our peaceful jungle lodge near the Sepilok Orangutan Center.Day 4: After a lazy breakfast, we walk a few hundred yards to the Sepilok Orangutan Rehabilitation Center to view an informational video and then walk through the rainforest to experience the orangutan feedings. After the feedings, some of the young orangutans laze near the boardwalk, offering great views! We walk back to our lodge for lunch and a rest. After lunch we head over to the Bornean Sun Bear Conservation Center, a new facility dedicated to promote sun bear conservation in Borneo through animal welfare, conservation, rehabilitation, education and research by giving captured sun bears a better home and restoring their right to live in the wild. You will truly be inspired by these bears and their story. We retire to our jungle lodge for another evening.Day 5: We take an early walk to the Rainforest Discovery Center. The Center has an exceptional natural history museum, and a series of elevated walkways and towers. From these platforms we will look for monkeys, birds and the famous primitve bird, the Borneo bristlehead. We return for late breakfast. Later, we leave for the jetty for our boat journey to our lodge on Sabah\u2019s longest river, the Kinabatangan. There are many opportunities to view birds and wildlife in virgin mangrove, wetland, and rain forest habitats along the way. After settling in at our riverside lodge, we set off in the late-afternoon and take a river cruise on a motorized boat to look for some of the 10 primate species that live in the area. A highlight will be spotting proboscis monkeys, often seen on the treetops along the river. Wild orangutans, long-tailed and pig-tailed macaques, monitor lizards, and various species of hornbills and kingfishers may be seen. If we are lucky, we may even see the wild Borneo pygmy elephant. We return to our lodge for a solar-heated hot shower, a candlelit dinner, and a slide show conducted by our resident naturalist.Day 6: We wake up to the jungle calls of the gibbons and hornbills with a cup of Sabah tea. An early river cruise up the Kinabatangan River gives us a chance to view more birds and wildlife, and perhaps see the blue-banded kingfisher. After breakfast we take an educational tour along the Hornbill Boardwalk located behind the lodge. In the afternoon we enjoy another river boat ride in the search for more wildlife, perhaps sighting some pygmy elephants bathing in the river.\u00a0Day 7: This morning we travel overland to Gomantong Caves. We\u2019ll walk just under a mile through the rainforest to get to the cave entrance. We learn about the balance of ecology with the cave bat, swift, and crab inhabitants. We then drive through some logged forests, cocoa and softwood plantations, and massive palm plantations to Lahad Datu, a small town with plenty of character. We learn how these operations affect the indigenous wildlife and how conservation efforts are developing to protect remaining habitat. After lunch we check into an attractive timber lodge at Tabin Wildlife Resort. Nestled within the rainforest beside the Lipad river, this lovely setting is home to a surprising variety of birds, insects and small mammals.\u00a0This area has many palm oil and cacao plantations, and we learn how these operations affect the indigenous wildlife and how conservation efforts are developing to protect remaining habitat. After lunch we check into an attractive timber lodge at Tabin Wildlife Resort. Nestled within the rainforest beside the Lipad river, this lovely setting is home to a surprising variety of birds, insects and small mammals, even right beside the buildings of the resort. In the afternoon, we trek on the Elephant trail to the active Lipad mud volcano which provides a mineral salt lick for wildlife. We climb the observation tower and admire the contrasting landscape of the bare mud volcano and its surrounding thick forest. Then head back down on the ground try to identify the multitude of animal footprints here. The adventurous can try a volcanic mud facial, said to be responsible for a fine complexion. After dinner, we enjoy a CD\/Slide presentation on Tabin\u2019s natural wonders, followed by a night safari to look out for nocturnal wildlife and birds.\u00a0Day 8: Join the early morning bird walk to discover some of Tabin\u2019s rich collection of almost 300 bird species and possibly view a gibbon family. After breakfast, we drive to the core area for animal spotting and photography before trekking through the lush green rainforest to visit Lipad Waterfall. We take a dip in the natural pool and enjoy a natural and refreshing shower under the waterfall. Alternatively explore the surrounding area or just relax. In the afternoon, we try out the Tabin Rainforest Foot Soak made with a natural blend of herbs, to relax tired muscles after long jungle treks or just enjoy the solitude. In the evening, we take a dusk drive to look for more nocturnal wildlife. After dinner, we have a night walk along the trail nearby the resort in search of sleeping birds, frog and nocturnal wildlife.\u00a0Day 9: Today we have a free morning to walk, bird, relax, or just visit with each other over coffee. In late morning we board our bus back to Lahad Datu. We transfer to four wheel drive vehicles to reach our next lodge, located on the Danum River at the edge of 438 square kilometers of undisturbed lowland rainforest.\u00a0This area is home to an incredible diversity of wildlife of more than 275 species of birds and 110 species of mammals, not to mention abundant plant life. We will be staying at a first-class nature resort, complete with all the usual luxuries for the next two nights. After hiking about four miles along the relatively level Riverside Trail in the afternoon, we enjoy a wonderful dinner. After dinner we view a presentation on the Danum Valley area before taking a night drive through the rainforest; if we are lucky, we may see nocturnal species such as civet, flying squirrel, porcupine, sambar deer, leopard cat, and slow loris.Day 10: Today we hike about six miles in this wild paradise. First we will take an early-morning bird walk of about a mile before breakfast, crossing gorges on the hanging walkways. Afterwards, we will look for sunbirds and bee-eaters and mammals in other parts of the park. We hike a half-mile uphill to Coffin Cliff, an escarpment lined with ancient burial coffins. We then trek to a waterfall and enjoy a cool dip in a rock-lined pool. After lunch we enjoy a canopy walkway for more birding or take an inner tube ride on the nearby river. We take another night drive this evening, weather permitting, to look for nocturnal animals and for the Borneo frog-mouthed owl.Day 11: We have a free morning to hike, relax, and ponder the pristine primary rainforest and what we have seen and done on our trip. We then take our four-wheel drive vehicles back to Lahad Datu. In the afternoon we fly back to Kota Kinabalu for a last night and farewell dinner together.Day 12: Sadly, our trip comes to an end after breakfast.

In applying for this trip, you will be putting yourself in the company of a dedicated group of volunteer leaders offering some of the best outings in the world. There\u2019s a lot of information here. Please read it in detail to assess whether this training is right for you.\u00a0The TrainingThe home phase of the training will be conducted from October 15, 2017 \u2013 April 15, 2018.\u00a0The hands-on field training will be conducted May 1-6, 2018 in the Galiuros, a 2 \u00bd-hour drive northeast of Tucson, Arizona. The mountains rise more than 4,000 feet above the surrounding valleys and reach over 7,500 feet. Giant saguaro cactus forests form the Sonoran Desert apron around these mountains, huge Arizona cypress trees stud the lush valleys, and towering Douglas firs drape the high country. The biologically important and sensitive San Pedro River riparian area cuts through a nearby valley. Due to the number of different life zones in the mountains, valleys, and riparian areas, there is a huge variety of plants and animals, including the rarely spotted jaguar.The Galiuros are a great place to learn how to become a Sierra Club leader and are especially great for learning or honing desert backpacking skills. We will start at Deer Creek and cross some beautiful high desert on good but confusing trails with some fine views before entering a fairly dense forest as we ascend 2,000 feet toward Kennedy Peak, the second highest in the range.\u00a0 The next day we will descend about 1,800 feet on a rocky trail through an interesting mix of desert and riparian vegetation to Rattlesnake Canyon, a valley that runs between the eastern and western ridges of the Galiuros.\u00a0 We then will hike on a good and easy trail through tall Ponderosa pines in Rattlesnake Canyon to a camp near a spring.\u00a0 The following day we will hike for a few miles in the lovely Rattlesnake Canyon with some intriguing pioneer remains before ascending 1,800 feet to the crest of the eastern ridge of the Galiuros.\u00a0 Closing our loop, we will descend 2,000 feet to Deer Creek and our vehicles. \u00a0We will average 5-7 miles each day, allowing time to enjoy backpacking but also leaving plenty of time for training.Enroll in the Class of 2018 and join hundreds of other Sierra Club leaders in a 100-year tradition, started by John Muir, to lead people into the most beautiful, inspirational mountains, forests, and deserts in the country to encourage stewardship of these special places.

The skills you learn during this trip will apply equally for the different types of National and International Outings that you may choose to lead: backpack, lodge, basecamp, water trips, or multi-sport trips. During the training, trainees will:Design and submit (using the National Outings Trip Submission System) an engaging and fiscally realistic outing that furthers the conservation mission of the Sierra Club.Write an engaging brochure that will effectively sell the trip.Plan an appetizing and accommodating menu.Conduct pre-trip interviews with mock sign-ups and accept appropriate participants for the outing.Participate fully in the field section of the training, both as a participant and leader-of- the-day.Demonstrate safety awareness, sound judgment and decision-making as part of the leader-of-the-day team.Demonstrate professional communication skills and maintain professional working relationships with home school mentor, field trainers, fellow trainees and leader-of- the-day leader throughout all of NOTT (home school and field training).Demonstrate the ability to manage all logistical aspects of a full day on a backpacking trip. This includes Leave No Trace, route finding, hazard assessment, and group energy level assessment, etc.About National OutingsWith more than 100 years of wilderness travel experience, and as a part of the largest grassroots conservation organization in the country, Sierra Club Outings offers more than 350 trips annually to unique destinations around the world. We aim to provide a variety of quality outdoor adventures for people of all ages. Our offerings include adventures in the U.S., Canada, and abroad, including backpacking, base camping, canoeing, kayaking, bicycling, rafting, sailing, skiing, snowshoeing, day hiking, service trips, lodge trips, and family vacations; domestic trips are generally 5\u201310 days in length, while international trips may last up to three weeks. National Outings provides services to about 4,000 participants per year. The 350 trips per year are led by approximately 500 volunteer leaders supported by a small staff in the Outings Department at the Club\u2019s headquarters in Oakland, California. Trips are priced for the program to operate on a long-term, break-even basis.The Ideal of Being a National Outings Leader: The opportunity to follow John Muir\u2019s example and inspire someone to make huge strides in protecting the natural world. The chance to share a remote, pristine, inspiring spot in the wilderness. At parties, you get to say \u201cYes, I\u2019m a leader for the world\u2019s oldest, largest and most effective environmental organization: The Sierra Club.\u201dThe Reality of being a National Outings Leader: Actually, these ideals can be the reality. However, the adage \u201cthere\u2019s no free ride\u201d is especially true. Becoming a volunteer leader for Sierra Club Outings takes loads of lead time, commitment, and training. For more than 100 years, we\u2019ve been offering wilderness trips, led by dedicated volunteers, to educate people about the need for protection of natural resources, and we\u2019ve developed procedures to ensure our trips are safe and successful. We\u2019re dependent on these volunteers, who are organized into subcommittees that are responsible for all offerings in their geographic area or their type of trip. For example, there are subcommittees for California backpacking, for the Southwest, for Alaska, and for Water trips in the West. There are 18 different committees in all, and many have their own set of special qualifications or requirements for leadership and for approval of proposed outings. While undeniably a lot of work, you\u2019ll find the rewards far exceed your efforts. Our training trip will take you through the process step by step, and give you lots of hands-on experiences and case studies to improve your skills and help you gain confidence.Upon successful completion, there are additional measures to ensure you\u2019re not thrown into a sink-or-swim situation. You may become a trainee or assistant on a trip and work with an experienced leader who will mentor you and provide answers to your questions about setting up a successful, enjoyable, safe, AND inspirational outing.CurriculumWe will cover the following curricula:Working with the office staff and volunteer leadershipTrip PlanningSafety ManagementParticipant Welcoming and Pre-Trip ScreeningInterpersonal Leadership SkillsGroup ManagementDecision Making and Problem SolvingWilderness Emergency ManagementNutrition and Food PlanningConservation through OutingsCultural History of the area we are travelling inNatural History of the area we are travelling inEquipment and Clothing SelectionHealth and Sanitation & HygieneCommon Medical Problems and PreventionLightening Safety and PreparednessLeave No TraceWater Purification & How-ToWeather and Weather Prediction","highlights":"Learn how to plan your own Sierra Club National Outing, Grow skills and self-confidence in outdoor leadership, Enjoy 4 days backpacking in a rarely visited SW locale","includes":"  Training in backpacking skills, especially for desert,   Transport to\/from the Tucson airport,   An Individualized Leadership Development Plan","itinerary":"Home SchoolOnce you have been accepted onto the trip (after registering for the training, submitting an application, and participating in 2-3 interviews), you should begin to complete the homework assignments. There is considerable work to be done before the field section.\u00a080% of the work is in the planning and preparation and 20% is in the actual field time. The\u00a0homework phase of the training takes 40-60 hours of time during the 5 months prior to the field trip, with deadlines specifically planned to meet volunteer\/staff leadership and Sierra magazine schedules. The training is conducted in the same way you will plan your future National outing:Due 5 Months before the Field Trip: Trip Expression of Interest, Title and CopyYou will work with your Home School Mentor to decide on the overarching trip plan you are considering. Your Home School Mentor will \"approve\" your outing in the same way that your National Outings Subcommittee Chair would. Additionally, you will craft your trip title and 30-60 word trip copy (for Sierra magazine).Due 4 Months before the Field Trip: Trip BudgetNow you will organize and plan out the actual costs of your trip in addition to finalizing your 30-60 word trip copy. You will submit this information using our online trip submission system and receive your trip budget with feedback from your mentor.Due 3 Months before the Field Trip: Trip BrochureYou will now have the chance to write the online trip brochure (same format as this one) for your trip. Your homework mentor will work with you to refine your drafts.Due 2 Months before the Field Trip: Food PlanningPlanning healthy and exciting meals for your mock trip is the most challenging step for most new leaders. You will have the chance to work with your homework mentor to develop and refine your menu, recipe document, and shopping list.Due 1 Month before the Field Trip: Participant Welcoming & Pre-Trip ScreeningDuring this final homework step, you will welcome and screen at least two mock trip participants for your trip and decide whether to accept them or not.Due shortly before the Field Trip: Leader of the Day (LOD) PlanningYou will spend time with your LOD partner(s) to discuss how you two will work \u00a0together on the field trip during your one day of leadership. This will be guided by a \u201cGetting Acquainted\u201d exercise that many leaders find helpful when working with someone new. Other planning tasks include drafting a Safety Management Plan for your designed trip and planning, buying, packing and bringing food for the group on your LOD day. Upon training completion you will be reimbursed for the food costs in the same way that trip leaders are.Field TripThe field trip is an immersion in Sierra Club best practices. Three veteran trainers will guide eight prospective leaders through all aspects of planning, preparing, and leading national outings. Although this is backpacking training, lessons learned are appropriate to all Sierra Club trips. Regardless of the style of Sierra Club trip you want to lead, this trip is for you.During each of four days in the field, two trainees will be Leaders of the Day, responsible for all aspects of the day, from safety management to morale. The days are long and full, and the trip is physically and mentally demanding. You will receive ongoing verbal\u00a0feedback while hiking, at a nightly debrief, in a personal development plan at the end of the trip, and in a close relationship with other Sierra Club leaders in the years ahead.The goal is to build your skills and leadership, and to ensure ongoing support through mentors and other Sierra Club resources, so that you are confident and comfortable to lead Sierra Club trips to help others Explore, Enjoy and Protect the Planet.After Home School and Field TripWhat the trainers will do:\u00a0Upon successful completion of this training, the trainers will submit a \"Training Trip and Trainee Summary\" (based on everyone\u2019s Leadership Development Plans) to each of the 18 subcommittee chairs who manage the 350 outings each year. Specific subcommittee staffing decisions are made by the subcommittee chair, not the Home School Mentors or Field Trainers. This summary will include a description of the training, what your strengths and areas of growth are, what subcommittees you are interested in, and what leadership role the trainers feel you are ready for (e.g. trainee, assistant, provisional leader, or needing more technical or leadership experience).What you will do:\u00a0You will receive a written Leadership Development Plan during your development plan meeting. This will highlight what you do well, what you need to work on, which subcommittees you might fit best in, and what roles these might be (based on your interests). About one month after the training trip, you should contact the subcommittee chairs (allowing them time to receive and digest the Training Trip Summary) to express your interest in leading and determining your next step. Your placements will be based on your specific skill set, training trip performance and your time availability. We will also do our\u00a0best to take into consideration your desired geographic location and\/or activity type.","leader1":"Shelly Eberly","leader2":"Becky Wong","leader3":"Barry Morenz"}},{"trip":{"title":"Treasures of Sicily and the Aeolian Islands, Italy","id":"18590A","dates":"May 3, 2018 to May 14, 2018","destination":"Europe, Italy","type":"International","group":"","difficulty":"","priceHigh":"4495","priceLow":"4495","image":{"src":"https:\/\/content.sierraclub.org\/outings\/sites\/content.sierraclub.org.outings\/files\/styles\/trip-teaser\/public\/trips\/main-images\/19605_1_DanPettit.jpg?itok=WIacYbH6","alt":"Treasures of Sicily and the Aeolian Islands, Italy"},"path":"\/outings\/treasures-sicily-italy#trip=18590A","overview":"The TripSicily, the largest of the Mediterranean islands, was dominated for centuries by a succession of ancient peoples including Phoenicians, Greeks, and Romans.

Battles began in earnest in 1862, with General Stonewall Jackson\u2019s campaign giving the Confederates hope. In 1863, General Robert E. Lee used the Valley as an \u201cavenue of invasion\u201d when he moved his troops north. And in 1864, the Valley was the site of multiple clashes. General Jubal Early had successes for the South, driving the Union troops out of the Valley. However, that fall, General Philip Sheridan began his scorched earth campaign, burning the land as he advanced south, taking control of the area for the North.Our work this week will focus on the site of the Third Battle of Winchester, which occurred in September 1864. The battle took place on an area that includes Winchester itself, runs along Opequon Creek, and continues toward the town of Berryville. The current site includes about 800 acres. Our work is likely to include trail maintenance, fence construction, reforestation, invasive species removal, and maintenance of the wayside exhibits.\u00a0While we\u2019re working, the Shenandoah Valley Battlefields Foundation, our sponsors, will teach us about the history of the site, the role of the Valley in the Civil War, and the Foundation\u2019s plans for the future of sites they preserve. We will be housed at the Hunting Ridge Retreat Center, a 350-acre retreat with a stocked fishing pond, miles of trails, a volleyball pit, a basketball court, and a tennis court.The week will not be all work. We will relax when we\u2019re \u201cat home\u201d each evening and also experience some of the history of the Valley as often as we can. On Sunday, after our orientation and dinner, we plan to walk the Third Winchester Battlefield, weather (and available daylight) permitting.

No Civil War tour would be complete without a visit to the Stonewall Confederate Cemetery and Winchester National Cemetery, which honor those who fought and died here. As time permits, we hope to view other Civil War era sites during our week in the Shenandoah Valley.The ProjectThe exact nature of our projects will depend on the most pressing needs of the Battlefield Foundation. Based on our discussions with the staff, we will almost certainly be working on trail maintenance, which is an ongoing need and critical to visitors to walk the site and understand how the fighting unfolded. We are also likely to help with maintenance of wayside exhibits since they are crucial to visitors\u2019 understanding of the site. Other projects may include fence building and reforestation to help recreate a sense of the landscape at the time of the battle.\u00a0Staff members who work with us during the week will guide our activities and share information about the Civil War in the Shenandoah Valley, preservation activities, and our specific site.

For many years this was the place to which Hansen's disease (leprosy) victims were banished to live in isolation from family and friends for the rest of their lives. Father Damien (now Saint Damien) and many others lived and worked in the colony to serve the patients, advocate for changes, and make patients' lives more bearable. Now, former patients live at Kalaupapa, coming and going as they choose. The cure of this disease has affected many. In Hawaii's ohana-based (family) society, exclusion was an extremely difficult burden to bear, affecting both the victims and their families on other islands. Discrimination against families was common in the early 20th century when there was great ignorance and fear of leprosy--EXPANDFROMHERE--.Geographically, Kalaupapa is an isolated leaf-like flow of lava extending into the windward Pacific coastline. Its several miles of coast are a combination of tide pools, rocky shorelines, and pristine white or black sand beaches. The community of Kalaupapa occupies a small portion of this land area, leaving open tracts of grassland and trees. Now a National Historic Park, established in 1980, the park encompasses a total area of 10,726 acres, including approximately 8,726 acres of land and 2,000 acres of offshore\/undersea area. Most of the land within the park boundaries is managed by NPS through formal cooperative agreements with various federal and state agencies, as well as private entities. The park was established to preserve the memories of the victims as well as maintain the settlements of Kalaupapa and Kalawao, a volcanic crater, rain forests and the iconic Molokai Lighthouse.Typically, all visitors entering the peninsula must have a permit, and only visitors of the remaining residents are permitted to stay overnight (those 16 and younger are excluded -- a holdover from the days when patients' infants and children were taken from them). The island of Molokai bills itself as \"the most Hawaiian island\" -- indeed it has been subject to less development than other islands, with a strong coterie of residents who prefer to keep their island rural. Kalaupapa has seen none of the development typical elsewhere in the islands, making it an unusually quiet and lovely (and many say spiritual) place to experience.The Project\"There is no way I could duplicate this trip at any price.\" \u00a0\u2013\u00a02015 participantOur commitment is for each of us to work 30 hours on a variety of projects during our stay, under the direction of Miki'ala Pescaia, Ranger Coordinator of Volunteers, Kalaupapa Historical Park.

Our 30-day trek will allow us to truly explore this remarkable place, where we\u2019ll find a thriving and undiminished traditional Tibetan culture -- their villages possibly the highest on earth. En route we\u2019ll pass some of the most majestic mountains in the world, including Dhaulagiri and the remote Kanjirobas.Publishing accounts of their journeys through Dolpo in the 1950s, Tibetologists Giuseppe Tucci and David Snellgrove brought the region to the attention of the West for the first time, followed in the early 1970s by Peter Matthiessen and zoologist George Schaller, who sought blue sheep and the elusive snow leopard.\u00a0 Still, outside visitors, especially to Upper Dolpo, have remained few in number. Most have been deterred by the remoteness, the complicated logistics, the topography, or by government restrictions. In an attempt to preserve the unique culture and ecosystems found here, the number of visitors allowed in remains strictly limited.Our journey through Dolpo will take us across the grain of the land like a slow roller coaster for about 200 miles. May and June are ideal months since the snow should be melted off the high passes, the monsoons have yet to begin, the skies should be clear, daylight hours will be long, birds will be active, and, hopefully, spring flowers will be emerging -- prickly blue poppies, the unusual androsace, and sleek anemones to name a few. We will have many high passes to cross on this route, the highest will be at an elevation of approximately 18,250 feet. If you are looking for a trek through verdant and comforting alpine scenery, this is not it! We will be hiking through a mostly treeless and wind-swept desert landscape of implausible gorges, high passes, and enormous vistas, desolate in its immensity. This is no tourist tea-house trek; it is remote, rugged, unspoiled, inspiring, and unforgettable -- arguably the best trek in the Himalaya.","highlights":"Trek for 30 days in a remote, highly restricted region, Watch for wildlife & learn about their conservation, Visit pre-Buddhist Bon and Buddhist monasteries","includes":"  Restricted-area permit fees, trek expenses & all tips,   Three in-country flights and airport transfers,   Six nights in hotels & meals in Kathmandu and Pokhara","itinerary":"Days 1-2:\u00a0Kathmandu (4,400 feet). Arrive and transfer to our hotel, then spend the afternoon around Bodnath, the largest Buddhist stupa in the world, visiting the gompas (monasteries) in the area. Very early the next morning, climb up to the Swyambunath temples. After breakfast, continue on to holy Hindu Pashupatinath and the Sleeping Vishnu at Budhanilkantha. In the afternoon, we'll finalize preparations for the trek.\u00a0Day 3:\u00a0Kathmandu - Pokhara (3,000 feet). We will board our chartered bus early for a seven-hour drive to Pokhara, situated on Phewa Lake. We'll arrive by early afternoon with plenty of time to explore.Day 4:\u00a0Pokhara - Marpha (8,500 feet). In the early morning, weather permitting, we will take a twin-otter flight up the Kali Gandaki gorge between Annapurna (26,538 feet) and Dhaulagiri (26,788 feet) to the Jomsom airstrip. We'll then hike about one hour downhill to the charming town of Marpha. There we'll meet our trekking staff, who will have brought all our gear up by road.\u00a0This will be our first night in tents.Days 5-6:\u00a0Marpha - Dangorjung (10,340 feet). Early this morning we will trek up the windy Kali Gandki Valley to Eklobatti. There, we leave the river behind and begin ascending to the northwest. We'll make camp at the village Dangorjung, with its small red-walled Buddhist temple and rows of ancient cottonwoods. We will stay here for two nights of acclimatization.Day 7:\u00a0Dangorjung - yak kharka (13,470 feet). Continuing up steeply, we will cross our first pass of note (14,200 feet) -- from there we can enjoy views of the Annapurna area, the Kali Gandaki gorge, Kagbeni, and to the northeast, the entire kingdom of Mustang. Drop from the pass to a meadow camp by mid-afternoon. We may take a second night here for acclimatization.Day 8:\u00a0Yak kharka - Sangdak (12,400 feet). Turning west, the trail floats over a small pass (about 14,600 feet), then drops to our first Tibetan-style village, Sangdak, \"the gateway to Dolpo,\" which clings picturesquely to a cliff above the yawning Chalung gorge. We stop here mid-day and make camp.Days 9-10:\u00a0Sangdak - base camp (13,930 feet). Leaving Sangdak, the trail climbs steeply to a small pass before descending into the Chalung gorge to cross the river on a bridge. The canyon is reminiscent of those in the American southwest. Climbing out of the gorge after lunch, we will make our way to our \"base camp\" for the upcoming major passes, situated in a scrubby, but welcoming, little juniper forest.\u00a0We will stay here two (or three) nights as necessary for acclimatization.Day 11:\u00a0Base camp - Thasan Chu (16,400 feet). Having two passes to cross today, we'll be on the trail by 6 a.m. We make our way to the top of the first, the Khog La (16,700 feet). Beyond this pass the trail contours into a long basin, and we'll stop for an early lunch before continuing over the Touje La (18,250 feet -- our highest altitude of the trek). We should reach its wind-swept top after a few more hours, gaining magnificent views of Dhaulagiri and Tukuche Peak to the south. Here we bisect the Dhaulagiri range and also cross the continental divide, leaving behind the Indian subcontinent and stepping onto the Tibetan plateau. We have entered Dolpo. The long descent is gentle, and we'll continue down to camp alongside the Thasan River (chu).Day 12:\u00a0Thasan Chu - Tsharka (14,135 feet). This is an open and wild landscape -- a new world of \"remote peaks crowned by remoter snows\" (George Schaller). The intensity of the geology is profound; you can easily see the uplift of the Asian plate being pushed from below by India. By late-afternoon we'll drop from the plateau down to the main river, crossing it on a new bridge. The trail gently follows the river and soon Tsharka village will come into view.Day 13:\u00a0\u00a0Layover in Tsharka (14,135 feet). The Dolpopa (inhabitants of Dolpo) refer to Tsharka as \"the edge of the world,\" and you may recognize it from scenes in Eric Valli\u2019s film \"Himalaya.\" We will pay visits to the two gompas, Buddhist and Bon, representing the two religions of Dolpo.Day 14:\u00a0Tsharka - Panzang Valley (15,420 feet). At the top of the pass beyond Tsharka (16,600 feet), the landscape in all directions is tremendous -- behind is the imposing Dhaulagiri massif, and to the north are endless exotic peaks. We'll descend into the Panzang Valley and camp alongside the river.Day 15:\u00a0Panzang Valley - Taraka Sumdo (13,990 feet). Following the river north, we will continue downstream in the ever-widening valley. The Panzang is one of the four main valleys that comprise Upper Dolpo -- the others being Tarap, Nangkhong, and Tsharka.Day 16:\u00a0Taraka Sumdo - Polde (13,970 feet). Rising to the east of us is the sacred mountain of Kula, which is also known for its medicinal plants. It has a pilgrim trail circling it (the Kula Ri). We have the option of ascending to join it, to follow part of this traditional nekhor, then descend to Balung temple and the village of Polde.\u00a0Or, we may reach Polde by simply continuing up the river valley.Day 17:\u00a0Polde - Tinkyu (13,500 feet). Hiking downstream to the village of Tinkyu will take less than two hours; the valley is a wide glacier-cut trough, carpeted with short grass. As usual, there won't be a tree in sight. Tinkyu sits at the meeting point of this valley and the Panzang (now about a half-mile across). It is a major village, with an old fort, many prayer walls, and two gompas.Day 18:\u00a0Tinkyu \u2013 Chanpola Goth (13,860 feet). Past Tinkyu, the gorge narrows considerably, and 10 miles downstream we will arrive at the prosperous village of Shimen -- its terraced buckwheat fields and little groves of willow will be a welcome sight. Leaving behind the main gorge, which is becoming a wild and precipitous place, we head toward our next pass (which we will cross the following day) and camp alongside a small stream.Day 19:\u00a0Chanpola Goth - Mu (13,780 feet). After continuing up the side valley, we then turn to cross a steep ridge to the north. From the pass, the Mu La (16,600 feet), the views across to Tibet are exhilarating. This is an extremely interesting, wildlife-rich area; we'll watch for herds of blue sheep, and signs of musk deer, Himalayan fox, and snow leopard. We'll then descend to the settlement of Mu.Day 20:\u00a0Mu - Dora Sumdo (12,140 feet). The side drainage we follow eventually returns to the main river canyon. On the 2010 trek it was here where the group had an unbelievably lucky sighting of a snow leopard -- drinking at the stream, stretching, rolling in the dust, and eventually disappearing over the far ridge! Onward we'll go to Nyisal, and then Yangtsher, one of Dolpo's oldest and most important monastery complexes. It appears on a platform about 400 feet above the river, surrounded by prayer walls, unmistakable with its nine great chortens. We continue downstream to camp at the confluence of two rivers.\u00a0Day 21:\u00a0At this point we have two route options for the next four days, both leading to the ultimate destination of Shey. One route is higher and with more mileage, going over the Yeng La and then through Bijher and Samling. The other is somewhat less demanding but equally interesting, passing through Namgung and then over the Se La. The leader will make the determination as to which route we will use. The following description for days 21-24 describes the first option, the Yeng La route.Dora Sumdo - Above Karang (14,700 feet). The next day, we'll continue on to explore the impressive village Karang, nestled in a gentle upland valley. Camp will be made in a high meadow some 500 feet above the village, making the pass crossing the next day a little easier.Day 22:\u00a0Above Karang - Bijer (12,641 feet). Leaving camp we will hike steadily up through a wilderness of rocks and scree to cross the Yeng La (17,717 feet). To the south rises Mukpo Rong, or \"Purple Mountain\"; it dominates the entire area and is the home of a local mountain deity. The descent is not steep, but it is long. Bijer finally appears late in the afternoon, some 5,000 feet lower than the pass. It is a large village with a very impressive health post, one of the most advanced in Dolpo.Day 23:\u00a0Bhijer - Tora (14,827 feet). A few hours' walk brings us to Samling, the oldest Bon monastery in Dolpo, built in an isolated position high above the precipitous gorge. After visiting, our rocky path ascends from the gompa, crossing the western flanks of Mukpo Rong, and continues on a few hours to Tora, an open meadow camp used by herders in the area.Day 24:\u00a0Tora - Shey (14,300 feet). Today we will cross two small passes, along the way admiring contorted cliffs of sacred Crystal Mountain, which rise to the east. We descend to Shey village and make camp.Day 25:\u00a0Layover at Shey. Today we'll hike a few hours to visit the remote hermitage Tsakang, made famous by Matthiessen in his book 'The Snow Leopard.' It is beautifully built, Anasazi-like, into the cliff face. Here the air, light, and sound have a rarified clarity that is like no other place on earth.Day 26:\u00a0Shey - Stream camp beyond pass (13,750 feet). Leaving Shey, we will ascend steeply to the Kang La (17,670 feet) to cross back over the continental divide. Snow is likely on our descent. Straight ahead lies the monumental, snow-covered northern face of the Kanjirobas -- imposing and still. The descent is long. At the end of this demanding day we will make camp in a meadow, alongside a stream.Day 27:\u00a0Stream camp - north shore Phoksumdo lake (11,900 feet). As we lose elevation, trees eventually make their appearance -- beautiful Himalayan birch with their spring green leaves. The valley broadens and suddenly the amazing site of deep and beautiful Phoksumdo lake appears. We camp on the north shore, under the birches.Day 28:\u00a0North shore of Phoksumdo Lake - Ringmo (11,900 feet). The trail around the large lake no longer bears resemblance to the treacherous one described by Matthiessen and Schaller (or as seen in the film \"Himalaya\"!); it simply climbs up about 1,000 feet above the water and undulates along, but it is not dangerous. From this vantage point, the view of the lake is unsurpassed. The blue is like no other, and the depth almost unfathomable. We will make camp on the southern shore, a 10-minute walk from the thriving village of Ringmo. Coming from the barren north, the green of the pines and junipers and the blue of the lake seem almost surrealistic.Days 29-30:\u00a0Ringmo - Dunai (6,870 feet). We'll leave the lake along its outflow stream, the Suli Gad. There will be a roar in the distance, and then it appears -- a massive 900-foot waterfall, the biggest in Nepal. A steep zigzag path descends alongside the falls. Continuing downstream, we'll stop to visit the thriving Tapriza boarding school, established specifically for Bon children. For about two days, we will follow the turquoise Suli Gad, passing through thick forests (some of giant red cedar). Finally, the Thulo Bheri River will come into view, and we enter Dunai -- the biggest town since we left Jomsom a month ago. It\u2019s an interesting and lively place, but also a little shocking -\u2013 radios and electric lights!\u00a0 We will visit schools and conservation offices there.Day 31:\u00a0Dunai - Jufal (8,200 feet). A morning\u2019s walk will bring us to Jufal, the location of the steeply inclined STOL airfield. We make camp here, as our flight will be in the early morning. This last evening we will have a party to express our gratitude to our porters and staff who have been so helpful to us for the last 30 days.Days 32-34:\u00a0We have built in extra \"buffer\" days that will be used during the trek, as needed.Day 35:\u00a0Jufal - Kathmandu. We will depart in our charter twin otter plane, landing in Pokhara. From Pokhara, we'll fly to Kathmandu on a regularly scheduled flight, arriving by mid-day.Days 36-37:\u00a0Kathmandu. As there are possible flight delays returning from Jufal, these two days will serve as a buffer, but we'll most likely be able to spend them sightseeing around the Kathmandu Valley -- visiting the many World Heritage sites there, such as Bhaktapur and Patan. On our last evening in Kathmandu, we will have our farewell dinner party.Day 38:\u00a0Departure.","leader1":"Cheryl Parkins","leader2":"Francy Rubin","leader3":""}},{"trip":{"title":"Preserving the Lost Coast, California","id":"18086A","dates":"May 12, 2018 to May 19, 2018","destination":"United States, California","type":"Service\/Volunteer","group":"","difficulty":"","priceHigh":"525","priceLow":"525","image":{"src":"https:\/\/content.sierraclub.org\/outings\/sites\/content.sierraclub.org.outings\/files\/styles\/trip-teaser\/public\/trips\/main-images\/17086_1_Bill%20Glenn.jpg?itok=e6f2zcA9","alt":"Photo: Bill Glenn"},"path":"\/outings\/preserving-lost-coast-california#trip=18086A","overview":"The Sharon Churchwell Fund is offering\u00a0adults 18-35 years old a full $300 off this trip.\u00a0Visit our\u00a0scholarships page\u00a0to apply.The TripOn the far northern shore of California lies the legendary Lost Coast, where the 4,000-foot King Range rises precipitously above the wild Pacific.

Formed by glaciers over 10,000 years ago, the Vineyard\u2019s distinctive landscape consists of kettle ponds, open meadows, dense forests, steep cliffs, and natural harbors. Its globally rare habitats include coastal sandplains, grassland heaths, and scrub oak woodlands.The Vineyard\u2019s bountiful lands and waters provided ample sustenance to Native Americans long before the first European settlers arrived in 1642. Over the next 200 years, islanders made their living as fishermen, merchant seamen, pilots, and whalers. Tourism constitutes the primary economic activity now. \u00a0During the summer the resident population of 15,000 swells to 150,000 tourists. The island\u2019s rich history is evident in its six towns. Each has its individual character expressed in widely divergent architectural styles -\u2013 from the gingerbread cottages of Oak Bluffs to Edgartown's aristocratic, white-clapboard sea captains' homes to the traditional fishing village of Menemsha. Today, farmers and fishermen remain close to the land and sea in the company of celebrities of all stripes.\u00a0 This proximity will give us the opportunity to sample the freshest seafood and some new dishes.\u00a0We will also visit Martha's Vineyard Camp Meeting Community. As described in Sally Dagnall's book, Circle of Faith:\"This is the story of a place founded in 1835 as a wilderness religious retreat, that is unlike almost any community in America. Stand amid the colorful painted cottages of the Martha's Vineyard Camp-Meeting Association, just a few yards from the busy commercial center of Oak Bluffs on Martha's Vineyard, and you just might hear echoes from the past: The \u201cfervid whooping\u201d of old-time ministers\u00a0demanding souls be saved and devils cast out. The sound of chatting women and men sitting in elaborate tents, or visitors complaining about their own close quarters in rooming tents strewn with straw for bedding. The sounds of a bell beginning and ending each day, and the hymns sung at services and prayer meetings held throughout the day.\"The ProjectThe FARM Institute is an educational non-profit institution committed to connecting people of all ages and all circumstances to agriculture through the diverse operations of a working farm.TFI provides year-round educational programs offering learning experiences in:Land preservation & environmental stewardshipAccepting individual responsibility & meeting commitmentsTeam work & cooperationFarming (field crops, produce, fruit, hay)Nutritional awarenessHumane livestock management (cattle, poultry, swine, sheep, goats)The culture & history of Martha's Vineyard farmingThe Sierra Club has worked with the Institute at the Farm since 2015. Spring farm chores will, of course, be part of the duty menu. We will assist in getting the Farm ready for their energetic and focused summer programs. The agenda may even include construction and building maintenance.Projects completed in previous years include: gardening, soil tilling, herding lambs, collecting eggs, weaning lambs, planting, weeding, mulching, mending fences, doing greenhouse work, feeding animals, cleaning chicken coops, pruning, herding sheep, mending tarps, moving cows to new pasture (they were really heavy to carry), helping to plan pasture for cows and sheep, stringing electric fence, moving sheep to new pasture, splicing sheep fencing, eradicating invasive plants, doing carpentry, constructing barn walls, making sandwich board signs for garden, constructing pergola, hanging barn doors, installing barn shelving, transplanting seedlings, learning hops growing and cultivation, mowing grass, weed whacking, painting barn partitions, staining chicken coops, constructing and hanging gates, moving freezers, and splitting a large storage shed into two buildings and moving them 50 yards to new sites.Note that because of the nature of service trips and the pre-planning needed, the work project may change and the Farm may have different priorities once our departure date arrives.","highlights":"Meet and work with the animals on a working farm, Participate in a diversity of projects and chores, Explore quaint island towns & gingerbread cottages","includes":"  All meals except one evening when we eat out,   Farm-fresh eggs for breakfast every day,   ","itinerary":"Day 1:\u00a0We will meet for dinner at the lodging on Martha\u2019s Vineyard.

Here, wildlife is easily approachable due to its isolation from many predators, including humans. The Gal\u00e1pagos Islands are among the world\u2019s foremost wildlife preserves, providing us with unique and amazing experiences. In fact, a full 50 percent of the species here are not found anywhere else in the world. Such creatures include the three-foot-long vegetarian marine iguana, which is the only known sea-feeding lizard on earth, and the Gal\u00e1pagos tortoise, which can grow to six feet in length, weigh 600 pounds, and live for 150 years. And or course, Darwin\u2019s finches, the icon of evolution--EXPANDFROMHERE--.\u00a0Darwin was the archipelago's most famous visitor; his chapter on the Gal\u00e1pagos in The Voyage of the Beagle remains a classic and is well worth reading. He made extensive collections of plants and animals and observations of their natural history, giving him sufficient material to support more than a quarter century of research. Twenty-four years later, he published the classic The Origin of Species, which shook the foundations of biological thought and led to profound changes in the philosophy of nature. These are the very islands that inspired Charles Darwin in 1835. We will visit the Charles Darwin Research Center.\u00a0We will be visiting both inhabited and uninhabited islands in the Gal\u00e1pagos. As we cruise between and around islands, we will search for pelagic birds such as shearwaters, storm-petrels, and tropicbirds; marine mammals like dolphins,\u00a0Gal\u00e1pagos\u00a0penguins, and sea lions; plus sea turtles, sharks and rays. Much of the unique life of the Gal\u00e1pagos is below water, and we will snorkel protected areas for close looks at the marine life. \u00a0On land, we will observe severe volcanic landscapes with its fascinating geologic features, walk through a lava tunnel, hike highland pastures searching for the giant\u00a0Gal\u00e1pagos\u00a0tortoise, walk through colonies of blue-footed boobies and frigatebirds, compare the beaks of Darwin\u2019s finches, step around piles of marine iguanas, and take in the culture of island villages. Our days will be filled with activity, but you'll also have the freedom to just relax. An English-speaking certified Gal\u00e1pagos naturalist will accompany us and help us understand the amazing relationships between plants, animals, people, and their environment.The play of light and water over the geologic landscape and the close encounters with wildlife make\u00a0Gal\u00e1pagos\u00a0a photographer\u2019s dream.\u00a0Our trip starts and ends in Guayaquil, the commercial hub of Ecuador and its major seaport.

From there we transfer via ferry across the narrow channel to Santa Cruz Island, where our bus will take us to our first adventure -- up to the highlands to search for giant\u00a0Gal\u00e1pagos\u00a0tortoise. We will see the landscape sharply change from coast to lush, mist-shrouded highlands; along the way, we will begin to encounter many of the famous bird species. The late afternoon will find us snuggling into our lodge in the coastal town and popular tourist center, Puerto Ayora--EXPANDFROMHERE--.\u00a0Day 4: A full day of marine discovery awaits us today as we cruise to North Seymore and Playa Las Bachas Beach. Here, a magical tour of enigmatic\u00a0Gal\u00e1pagos\u00a0wildlife awaits with boobies, frigate birds, lava herons, lava gulls, and marine iguanas -- all up close and unafraid of us. Playa Las Bachas is one of the main nesting sites for sea turtles on Santa Cruz. A pond behind the beach\u2019s dunes may harbor flamingos and migratory shorebirds. The short walk around the lagoon lets us also study the island\u2019s unique botany.Day 5: The Charles Darwin Research Station is our first visit today. Our\u00a0Gal\u00e1pagos\u00a0guide will explain the turtle breeding program while we try to sort out the different species of giant tortoise at the facility. This wooded facility harbors several species of finch and island lizards. The Center is home to the scientific programs on the islands and also acts as the main educational center for visitors. A wealth of information is available through their online portal (darwinfoundation.org\/datazone).\u00a0In the afternoon we will visit Tortuga Bay Beach\u2019s white sandy beaches to relax or snorkel.Day 6: On to Isabella Island! This morning our speedboat will take us to our next island in time for lunch in Puerto Villamil, where we will check into our beachfront hotel. In the afternoon, a walk through mangroves along a wooden pathway reveals an intertidal pond, both frequented by sea lions and enjoyed by locals for swimming and snorkeling. Penguins have been also been reported here.Day 7: Today we get aerobic with a hike up the volcano to Sierra Negra and Volcano Chico. Along the way, we enjoy the changing habitats and birdlife, but geology is the focus of the day as we attempt the rim of the second-largest volcanic caldera in the world. A box lunch will maximize our time in the field. Time and energy remaining, we will visit the Arnaldo Tupiza Centro de Crianza de Tortugas Turtle Center back in the village.Day 8: We\u2019ll be back in the marine and coastal environment for this day\u2019s excursion to Cabo Rosa (Los Tuneles), with lunch in the field. This unique spot is a marine paradise; one of the most famous snorkeling spots in the\u00a0Gal\u00e1pagos. Lava flows into the ocean have formed tunnels in the water, for which this site is named. Flightless cormorants, only found in the\u00a0Gal\u00e1pagos, may be seen here, along with penguins, sea turtles, and sea lions.\u00a0Day 9: Off to our last island, this time by plane, to San Cristobal Island. This is the oldest island geologically and the first island of Darwin\u2019s visit. Its main town is Puerto Baquerizo Moreno, the capital of the\u00a0Gal\u00e1pagos\u00a0province, which fronts the water, intriguingly named Shipwreck Bay. We will visit the Interpretative Center and explore the Center\u2019s trails, and have time to relax, explore the town, or take a dip at the beach across from our hotel.Day 10: Up in the highlands is the Hacienda El Cafetal coffee plantation, producer of\u00a0Gal\u00e1pagos\u00a0Coffee, a UNESCO Patrimony of Humanity Site (a sustainable resource for island peoples). The plantation has been growing organic, bird-friendly, and sustainable shade-grown coffee from heirloom plants since 1875. We will tour the plantation and local surroundings. Weather permitting, we will explore along this island\u2019s single road.Day 11: Our last full day in\u00a0Gal\u00e1pagos\u00a0will take us to Kicker Rock by boat for a full day of exploring remarkable shorelines, snorkeling, and possibly sighting a\u00a0Gal\u00e1pagos\u00a0specialty, the scalloped hammerhead. We will have lunch on a nearby beach to swim, bird the booby and frigatebird rookeries, snorkel, take photos, or just take in the magic that is these islands are famous for.

This corner of the Colorado Plateau lives up to those images and much, much more. Three hundred million years ago, the one-kilometer-thick salt layer, deposited by the alternate filling and drying of immense seas, began to move upward under great pressure. This caused the upper layers of sandstone to buckle and break, and the work of both the Colorado and Green rivers dug huge canyons though it all. Combine these fantastic rock formations with the high desert vegetation of sage, pinion, and juniper and you have a world that invites you to stop and think, to feel your place in the universe, and be at peace. However, the recent dramatic increase in the number of visitors has brought equally dramatic problems to this one-of-a-kind park--EXPANDFROMHERE--. This year, we hope to start a tradition of highly successful service trips to this park. Our work will take us to scenes of stunning beauty that need immediate attention if we are to preserve them for the future. We will have the satisfaction of knowing that our urgently needed work has contributed to the beauty and preservation of Canyonlands National Park.The ProjectAll winter long, the National Park Service keeps a \u201cwish list,\u201d and waits for Sierra Club volunteers to return in the spring, when we work directly with Park Service staff on projects that have the highest priority at the time. This wish list may include trail work, fencing, removal of exotic vegetation, and other maintenance projects. Assignments are posted and crews rotated, so no one should be bored. Although no experience is required, common sense, good humor, and a good attitude are mandatory. Our rule on these trips is that everything we do is necessary, and whatever we complete is sufficient. Everyone should leave with a sense of accomplishment.To help the Park Service staff direct our efforts most efficiently, all participants are urged to advise the leader of special skills or interests, e.g., carpentry or masonry, operating small tools, graphics and photography, a temperament for detail work, a preference to begin a task and follow it through to completion. But don\u2019t think you will be limited to using those skills; every participant will have a chance to work on a variety of projects within our overall goal of accomplishing what the park service asks us to do.Participants should be ready to teach and to learn new skills as our work requires.

Our hikes will take us through verdant forests, alongside volcanic mountains, and into breathtaking valleys. We begin our journey by hiking ancient forested Buddhist pilgrim paths on the Kunisaki Peninsula in Kyushu, Japan's southernmost large island. Mine-iri, a monk\u2019s practice of traversing sacred mountain paths in prayer, has been part of the religious life of Kunisaki since the ninth-century. Even today, monks occasionally make use of these trails. At times we'll put on our gloves, so we can use placed chains as climbing aids up steep volcanic ridges, before invariably heading down again into lush green valleys. The trails lead us to temples and shrines along the way.We'll also encounter some of Kyushu's volcanoes. Just south of Kunisaki Peninsula, near the resort town of Yufuin, we will ascend Mount Yufu. Farther south, at Aso-Kuju National Park, we will hike very near Mount Aso, where we hope to get a glimpse of this active volcano. While these fantastic volcanic formations are breathtaking in their own right, they provide stunning views of the surrounding forests, too.On other parts of our journey we'll take ferry rides to adjoining islands. First, we'll enjoy a brief overnight visit to the small island of Hime-shima. We'll stay in a family-owned ryokan (small inn), where we'll enjoy fresh seafood and a sunset over the beach. The next morning, we'll hike up to a small shoreline vista with spectacular views.\u00a0We also visit a much larger island, taking a two-hour journey south of Kyushu on a high-speed jet foil. Thickly forested Yakushima Island juts abruptly out of the ocean to a height of more than 6,000 feet. We'll stay two nights there, time enough to explore the island's historic old cedar forests, high moorlands, and grasslands. The entirety of the island is a designated World Heritage site.Each day we will end our walks by soaking in thermal hot springs (\"onsen\") or heated tubs. Most nights are spent in small family-owned Japanese ryokans, where we have our evening meals prepared fresh on site. Don\u2019t worry about bringing a lot of extra clothing for evening wear. Yukata, or Japanese robes, and the ubiquitous slippers are provided at almost all of our stays.\u00a0We also plan to visit a samurai village and a few other cultural sites. Time permitting, we will visit a brewing company, where we will learn the fine art of brewing sake and, if you wish, sample some of the final product. You will learn a lot about Japan's geography, customs and history during this trip.

We will then visit Usa Jingu, an ancient and impressive Shinto shrine. This shrine was instrumental in the development of the distinct Buddhism of the Kunisaki Peninsula. Dinner at tonight\u2019s lodging is a Japanese feast of locally caught fish and home-grown farm produce. Dinner provided.Day 2:\u00a0Futago-ji - Matama Onsen. After breakfast at our accommodation, a minibus will take us on a 25-minute journey to our start point at the heart of the Kunisaki Peninsula. Luggage, aside from daypacks, is forwarded on to our evening's lodgings for us. Very soon after the start of the trek, we find ourselves in a verdant forest and remote countryside. We visit some secluded temples and have lunch in a small, local restaurant. The afternoon's trek includes a short but stiff climb, using a chain assist in one area, up to a view of Mumyo-bashi: a bridge perched spectacularly between two crags. The final descent brings us down to road level and our last temple for the day. From here it is a 45-minute walk to a well-deserved thermal hot spring and our lodgings for the night. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner provided. Total walking time: six hours. Total distance: approximately 7.4 miles.Day 3:\u00a0Matama Onsen - Hime-shima. Our luggage is sent on by taxi, while we travel a short distance by minibus to the beginning of Nakayama Senkyo, a lower elevation ridge climb. Near the top on narrow ridges we will see some spectacular views over the surrounding countryside and the Seto Inland Sea.\u00a0We'll have a delicious bento box lunch. After lunch we wind our way up over a pass using a chain to assist us in a steep area before descending to an idyllic hamlet. We then meet our transport, which takes us to nearby Imi Port. Hime-shima, a small island, is 20 minutes away by ferry. From there we have a short walk from the quay to our inn for the night. The island is a delightful place, with the main settlement a maze of narrow streets, houses, and little vegetable plots. Our dinner is focused on locally caught fresh fish from some of the best fishing grounds within the Seto Inland Sea. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner provided. Total walking time: five hours. Total distance: approximately. 4.9 miles.Day 4:\u00a0Hime-shima \u2013 Monjusen-ji. We return by ferry to Imi Port after a short but beautiful visit to a local temple. After sending our luggage on, we have lunch at a local restaurant before catching a bus\/taxi to the start of today's trek. We soon pass through the atmospheric grounds of a long-gone temple. Little is left of this once powerful institution except stone Buddha statues and hundreds of monks' gravestones. The latter includes Ninmon's last resting place. Ninmon was the monk that is reputed to have first brought Buddhism to Kunisaki some 1,100 years ago. A climb to Itsutsu-ji Fudo provides impressive views across the Seto Inland Sea to Honshu and Shikoku, respectively Japan's first and fourth main islands. From here we also have grandstand views over to Hime-shima. Next, we walk down through forests to Monjusen-ji, a temple perched on a high cliff. Breakfast and dinner provided. Total walking time: four hours. Total distance: approx. 4.9 miles.Day 5:\u00a0Monjusen-ji - Futago-ji - Baien-no-Sato. Today, we pass through virgin forests and cedar plantations before we descend to an old village to join a little-used ancient track to Futago-ji, the principal temple on Kunisaki. After lunch at a local restaurant, a minibus picks us up to take us to our nearby lodgings for the night; another onsen. The lodgings here are dominated by the rare attraction of a giant, 25-inch reflecting telescope. Another sumptuous Japanese evening meal follows. Weather permitting; we will have the opportunity to look at the stars above Kunisaki through the telescope. The skies here are frequently very clear and a cloudless night can provide spectacular vistas of the heavens. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner provided. Total walking time: four hours. Total distance: approx. 4.3 miles.Day 6:\u00a0Baien-no-Sato - Kitsuki - Yufuin. Today we will visit Walk Japan\u2019s office and see the conservation projects they have initiated to support the community and protect the area. We visit the lovely Fuki-ji Temple, followed by the Kumano Magaibutsu, the little-known but largest Buddha relief carvings in Japan. Here we will enjoy a nicely prepared bento lunch. After lunch, we will take a look around Kitsuki, the quiet town's old samurai quarter, featuring buildings from feudal Edo Period Japan. En route to the spa resort town of Yufuin, we visit a sake brewery for a look around and a sample or two of the brewer\u2019s award-winning products. We spend the next two nights in a historic ryokan (traditional inn with thermal hot springs), in the center of Yufuin. This inn has been operated by one family for many generations; in a bygone era, it was frequented by the Japanese upper classes. Breakfast and dinner provided. Total walking time: three hours. Total distance: approx. 2.1 miles.Day 7:\u00a0Yufuin - Mt.Yufu - Yufuin. We have a choice today to either climb Mt. Yufu or relax in the pleasant surroundings of Yufuin, a charming resort town dominated by Mt. Yufu. For the hearty hikers, we take a minibus to the start of our 2,300-foot climb of Mt. Yufu (elevation 5,194 feet). At the mountain's peak, a grand panorama across Kyushu to an active volcano and Beppu Bay awaits us and makes a wondrous backdrop to a picnic lunch. After our walk, reinvigorating thermal hot spring baths are followed by another Japanese feast for dinner. Breakfast and dinner provided. Total walking time: six hours. Total distance: 6.2 miles. Total vertical ascent: 2,625 feet.Day 8:\u00a0Yufuin - Mt. Aso - Kagoshima. Today, we take the spectacular Yamanami Mountain Highway to the area that leads to the giant caldera of Mount Aso, Japan's largest active volcano. Our hike is dependent on the activity of the volcano and safety during our scheduled visit. The smell of sulfur is ever-present, and on some days, the volume of gas expelled by the volcano is so great that access to Mt. Naka's active crater and volcanic crater lake is restricted. After our selected hike we will be transported to Kumamoto. Here we board Japan\u2019s newest Shinkansen bullet train for Kagoshima, arriving mid-evening. Our hotel is near the station and tonight we\u2019ll take the opportunity to head into town and eat at an izakaya, a lively restaurant and local Japanese favorite. For those who wish, musical or not, there\u2019s an optional visit to another Japanese favorite, a karaoke bar. Breakfast and dinner provided. Total walking time: to be determined at arrival.Day 9:\u00a0Kagoshima - Mt. Kaimon - Ibusuki. Before leaving our hotel, we send our main luggage on to Yakushima for day ten, so we pack an overnight bag with enough for today and tomorrow\u2019s activities. With our overnight bag, we set off for Ibusuki and Mt. Kaimon. The latter is known as the \"Fuji of Satsuma\" because of its striking similarity to its famous counterpart. Satsuma was the original name of the Kagoshima region. We will be rewarded with great views back toward Kagoshima and Kirishima, as well as southwards to the island of Yakushima, our destination tomorrow, weather permiting. Covered with wildflowers during the warmer months, Mt. Kaimon also has historical significance. For many members of the Special Attack Corps, or Kamikaze Squadron, Mt. Kaimon was the last view of their homeland as they embarked on their fatal missions. After descending Mt. Kaimon, depending on time available, we may visit the acclaimed Peace Museum for Kamikaze Pilots in Chiran before making our way to our thermal hot spring lodgings in nearby Ibusuki. Ibusuki is a seaside town famed in Japan for its thermal sand baths. Breakfast and dinner are provided. Total walking time: four and a half hours. Total vertical ascent: approximately. 1,312 feet.Day 10:\u00a0Ibusuki - Yakushima. After breakfast, it is a short distance from our lodgings to the port in Ibusuki, where we catch an early morning, high-speed jetfoil to Yakushima Island. On arrival, we head straight for Shiratani Unsuikyo, a spectacular gorge that provides the backdrop for today's walking. This will be our first taste of Yakushima, a truly spectacular natural environment with climatic zones ranging from sub-tropical around the coast to frigid temperatures atop the island's highest peaks. Not surprisingly, a huge variety of flora and fauna find their homes here. Yakushima is officially one of the wettest places on earth, with upwards of 4,000 mm (13 feet) of rainfall recorded annually. Rain should not impair our enjoyment of our time here, but weatherproof gear is highly recommended. The rain actually adds greater atmosphere to the primeval forest we walk through. The forest includes giant, moss-covered cedars which are among some of the oldest trees in the world. We are guaranteed close encounters with deer and monkeys. Hayao Miyazaki, the Oscar-winning animator, found inspiration here for the scenery in Princess Mononoke, one of his most celebrated films. Weather and energy permitting, we'll take the trail as far as Taikoiwa, a giant viewing rock offering excellent views of the island's interior and high peaks, before descending to our lodgings for the evening. Breakfast and dinner provided. Total walking time: five hours. Total ascent: approximately 1,968 feet.Day 11:\u00a0Yakushima. Today's plans will be largely weather dependent, but a fine day will see us attempting an ascent of Mt. Kuromi Dake, a granite peak of 6,007 feet. This will necessitate an early start, but keep your eyes open as we take the winding mountain road up from the port of Anbo -- it's worth it for the views back toward the coast. The well-maintained trail to the top passes through a variety of cedar forest, high moorland, and grassland. Depending on the weather and cloud level, a number of alternative options are possible. These include an ascent of Mt. Mocchomu-dake via a viewpoint overlooking the spectacular Senpironotaki Falls; and a hike in Yakusugi Land, another area of impressive giant cedars and fast-flowing rivers. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner provided. Total walking time: around six to eight hours. Total ascent: approximately 2,625 feet.Day 12:\u00a0Yakushima \u2013 Kirishima. Following breakfast, we take the first flight back from Yakushima to Kagoshima. While our luggage goes on to our accommodation, we head for the mountains of Kirishima. We start on the Lake Onami path and 40 minutes later arrive at the lake. Lying 4,242 feet above sea level, it's the largest crater lake at this altitude in Japan. It is a good point to stop for a rest and take in the expansive views. According to legend, a dragon resides in the lake and at one point took the form of a beautiful maiden, living amongst local villagers for a while before returning to its home beneath the waters. We continue around the lake taking in good views of neighboring Mount Takachiho and the surrounding national park if the weather is clear. Our bus will take us back to Kirishima Jingu and our lodgings. Breakfast and dinner provided. Total walking time: five to six hours. Total vertical:\u00a02,133\u00a0feet.Day 13:\u00a0Kirishima - Kagoshima Airport. After breakfast we bid farewell and transfer to Kagoshima Airport, where the tour concludes.

Launching from Crystal Geyser just above a colorful canyon, we begin to meander peacefully downstream to the rhythm of dipping paddle strokes and settle into river time. The canyon grows deeper with every twist of the river as cliff walls rise sharply from the river\u2019s edge, displaying a rainbow of colors with the changing light of the day. Listen quietly and you will begin to hear the sounds of the desert, the soft wind in a cottonwood tree, the shriek of a peregrine falcon or the rumble of rock as a Desert Bighorn sheep comes down to the river at dusk. In the cool morning air, we\u2019ll hike up narrow side canyons to eerie panels of 800-year-old Indian rock art, which tell a story we do not fully understand. Our 60-mile guided paddle is considered the premier calm water canoe trip in the Southwest--EXPANDFROMHERE--.During this multi-activity adventure, we\u2019ll explore by canoe and trail the remote 1,500-foot depths of Labyrinth Canyons below the town of Green River, Utah until our takeout at Mineral Bottom. Several side canyons are geologically and scenically unique and reveal oasis-like microhabitats with spring-fed creeks that are a lush reprieve from the prickly pear cactus environment. Large cottonwood and box elder trees provide shade for humans and wildlife. There is adequate time for hikes through several of these wild side canyons. Then we\u2019ll jump back in the canoes and glide past red tail hawks, great blue herons, lizards, and stately mule deer. Scenic undeveloped campsites are abundant and accessible only by boat. \u00a0On the water we\u2019ll paddle past the vertical cliffs of the Carmel, Navajo, Wingate, and Monenkopi rock formations. These are some of the famous rock layers found in nearby Canyonlands and Arches national parks. The walls will light up with a distinct glow at sunset, often preceded by a brief afternoon thunderstorm and rainbow. This is a very remote desert wilderness with few man-made intrusions. The days are warm, so swims are a welcome addition to the day\u2019s activities.Ancient Fremont and more recently Ute Indians lived in these canyons as evidenced by cliff dwellings, rock art, and granaries. Almost every major side canyon along the river has Indian rock art, chipped petroglyphs, and painted pictographs. Bizarre anthropomorphs, desert animals, and daily life are portrayed on the stone. You\u2019ll also be following in the paddle strokes of Dennis Julian, a fur trapper who traveled the river by canoe and left his signatures in 1836.\u00a0 He was followed later by Major John Wesley Powell in 1869 whose expedition rowed heavy oak boats, recorded detailed scientific information, and named many of the prominent landscape features. During this outing, a special emphasis is placed on learning about the area\u2019s Indian culture, history, and stunning natural resources.Labyrinth Canyon has a mellow current and minor riffles, and no major rapids (rated Class II). Our two-person canoes should be able to pass through the canyons without great difficulty, but you\u2019ll need to paddle through the flat water sections. This makes it an ideal trip for persons who are active outdoors and experienced campers, but who may have little or no previous canoeing experience. More experienced canoeists will enjoy rhythmic paddling, the spectacular scenery, and the stories told by our expert guides. Participants will share a canoe with another person, help to carry group gear in their canoe, and assist in loading and unloading group equipment at camp. This is a shared experience.Camping is done on large sandbars or at the mouth of side canyons. Hikes are usually available at every camp.\u00a0 It is hot in the afternoon, with highs in the upper 80s and cooler in the morning with low temperatures in the 50s. We\u2019ll float in the river often to cool off and drink lots of provided water to stay hydrated. We follow Leave No Trace guidelines for desert river corridors to minimize our impact on this fragile environment, including using chemical toilets for solid human waste. There will be no plumbed or pit toilets available on the river. Sun protection is also very important. A complete checklist of what to bring will be provided by your leader upon acceptance. All meals are included from lunch on day one to lunch on day five.\u00a0 Every meal has fresh ingredients and ample quantities.During this shoulder season, we avoid the extreme heat of mid-summer without sacrificing warm weather and water. It's possible to have summer-like sun or cool fall days; rain, sometimes heavy; and ghostly morning fog. Do not make plans to leave the area on the last day of the trip in case we are delayed. Instead, join the group for a no-host celebration dinner after we get back to the town of Moab, Utah.Sights to see before or after the river trip:Visit the bizarre rock formations in Goblin Valley State Park outside Green RiverHike the trails of Arches National ParkView the fossils at the Cleveland Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry outside Price, UTExplore Nine Mile Canyon Archaeological PreserveCool off in high alpine meadows of the Highway 31 Energy Loop Nat\u2019l Scenic Byway","highlights":"Canoe slickrock desert canyons and hike side canyons, View ancient Indian rock art and pioneer history sites, Observe bighorn sheep and other desert wildlife","includes":"  Two-person canoes, canoeing gear, and most meals,   Licensed professional guides,   Information on natural history and Indian cultures","itinerary":"Pre-Trip:\u00a0Plan to arrive no later than mid-to-late afternoon Sunday.

We will receive a safety orientation, basic paddling instruction for those who wish, and a demonstration on the best way to load our canoes. Then we\u2019re off on our 60-mile descent downriver. A stop for lunch on a pretty beach will be next, then on to camp by 2-4 p.m. Canoes will be unloaded as a group activity, and everyone can set up their tents while the guides assemble the kitchen and begin dinner preparations.Days 2-4: After eating a hearty breakfast and breaking down camp, we begin our first full day on the river. Depending on the campsite, we may begin with a hike to explore a side canyon or complete loading the canoes and paddling downstream. The San Rafael River flows into the Green, giving us more water and the opportunity to paddle through a confluence. \u00a0As the river cuts deeper into the rock formations, the walls rise above us, revealing the multitude of layers and colors of stone laid down millions of years ago. We will stop at the Trin Alcove -- made up of three lovely slot canyons that intersect at the river with great hiking possibilities -- and continue on into Labyrinth Canyon. Highlights include Bowknot Bend (where the river makes a complete loop coming back to a point only a few hundred yards from where it passed some seven miles upstream), Hell Roaring Canyon, and Horseshoe Canyon. Ancestral Puebloan (Anasazi) rock art called petroglyphs are seen in several areas, and granaries are common along the canyon walls. \u00a0Historic sites include the outlaw cabin supposedly used by Butch and Sundance in their horse thieving days, and Register Rock, where explorers and trappers left inscriptions dating as far back as 1836. There will be plenty of hiking opportunities, including from our campsites.Day 5: Our final day on the river will pass through more spectacular scenery as we come to the take-out at Mineral Bottom after lunch. Gear will be transferred from canoes to trailers and then we begin the 900-foot ascent up the Horsethief Trail in our shuttle vehicles. This is a very steep and precarious-switchbacked one-lane dirt road, 1.5 miles long, where we can take one last look at the river from the top. We should be back in Moab before 5 p.m. NOTE: If there has been heavy rain, Mineral Bottom road becomes impassable for shuttle vehicles and the end of our trip will be somewhat delayed.Tipping: Tips are not included in the trip price. However, you may feel the guides have earned a gratuity for their hard work to make the trip as enjoyable as possible.","leader1":"Kate Sender","leader2":"","leader3":""}},{"trip":{"title":"From the Sea to the Mountains: Hiking Across Northern Greece","id":"18605A","dates":"May 14, 2018 to May 25, 2018","destination":"Europe, Greece","type":"International","group":"","difficulty":"","priceHigh":"3645","priceLow":"3125","image":{"src":"https:\/\/content.sierraclub.org\/outings\/sites\/content.sierraclub.org.outings\/files\/styles\/trip-teaser\/public\/trips\/main-images\/18605_1_AngelaWhite.jpg?itok=hfEKvdQ4","alt":""},"path":"\/outings\/national\/brochure\/hiking-mountains-sea-northern-greece#trip=18605A","overview":"The TripNorthwest Greece is a hidden gem; a gorgeous, scenic corner of Greece and a window to the past where life continues as it has for centuries, untouched by modern-day existence.

It was first suggested by Alfred Wainwright, a British fellwalker, guidebook author, and illustrator (1907-1991), and describes a 190-mile walk, in an approximate beeline, having a preference for the high ground and crossing some of England\u2019s most stunning countryside. Our walk covers 90+ miles of the original route and begins at St. Bees Head on the coast of the Irish Sea--EXPANDFROMHERE--. We will walk through three of England's national parks: the Lake District, renowned for its gorgeous lakes and craggy peaks; the Yorkshire Dales, with its gentle green valleys full of ancient stone walls and old farms, and popularized by the PBS series,\u00a0All Creatures Great and Small; and the North York Moors, which is secluded and lush with heather, and ends at a picturesque coastline along the North Sea. Along the way we will stop in remote and quiet old country villages and hamlets to refresh ourselves in pubs and tea rooms and we\u2019ll also take time to wander through medieval ruins and monuments giving evidence of England\u2019s ancient history.Our adventure begins with a visit to Carlisle Castle, which has been standing guard for over 900 years. Our luggage will be shuttled by van daily to the next B&B, leaving us free and unburdened to enjoy our day with just a day pack. Our walks vary in length from 7\u201313 miles each day and on occasion, our van will transport us across sections of this classic walk.We will be accompanied by some local ramblers on several walks and they will also join us for dinner, giving us insights into the rhythm of life in rural England.

Our trip officially begins after breakfast, when we meet to review the day\u2019s activities, address any last-minute questions, and then take off on a walking history tour of the castle and the town of Carlisle. After lunch, our van will take us to St. Bees and our accommodations. This is about a one-hour drive away. After checking in, we have a tour of St. Bees Priory--EXPANDFROMHERE--. This site originated in the 7th century as a nunnery established by St. Bega and later became a Benedictine Priory in the 12th century. We regroup again afterward for dinner.Day 2: St. Bees to Cleator. (9.4 miles, elevation change +1,100 feet, -1,000 feet) After the traditional dipping of our boots into the Irish Sea, we will begin the ascent and traverse of St. Bees Head, a three-mile-long promontory that ends in cliffs that fall 300 feet to the Irish Sea. On a clear day, you can see the Lakeland fells (hills) to the east and the Isle of Man to the west. Following lunch at a small village, we wind our way through a network of fields and lanes to Cleator. At the end of today\u2019s walk, we take some time for well-deserved refreshments at a local pub before being transported to our B&Bs to freshen up for dinner.Day 3: Ennerdale Bridge to Honister.

After a lunch break at Black Sail Youth Hostel, formerly a shepherd\u2019s hut, we have a strenuous 1,000-foot climb over Honister Pass, overshadowed by the magnificent mountain scenery of Pillar (2,927 feet) and Great Gable (2,949 feet) and the rugged Haystacks, where Wainwright\u2019s ashes are scattered. The path leads down to Honister Quarry, where we will visit one of the oldest slate mines still operating. From there, we will board our waiting bus to our B&B accommodations at Borrowdale, a very picturesque Lakeland valley.Day 4: Stonethwaite to Grasmere. (8.5 miles, +1,950 feet, -2,050 feet) Our second day in the Lake District starts by walking into the secluded side valley of Stonethwaite, dominated by Eagle Crag. Next is Greenup Edge, the pass separating Borrowdale and Grasmere in the Far Easedale valley. Pending fine weather after lunch, we may elect to continue up to the summit rocks of Helm Crag, better known as \u201cThe Lion and The Lamb,\u201d an amazing array of pinnacles and tilted rock slabs. Following our ascent, we\u2019ll descend into the historic village of Grasmere, the birthplace of William Wordsworth. We will overnight in Grasmere.Day 5: Grasmere to Patterdale.

Beyond the pass we descend to walk alongside the lake between Helvellyn Peak (3,118 feet) and St. Sunday Crag, and continue onwards to Glenridding, where we will spend the next two nights.Day 6: Howtown to Glenridding. (6.5 miles, +1,000 feet, -1,000 feet) Today we will deviate from Wainwright's classic route to see the gorgeous Ullswater Lake, the second largest lake in the Lake District and shaped like a dog\u2019s leg. We take a boat ride on one of the historic passenger vessels from lakeside Glenridding to Howtown. Afterward our return hike follows the lakeshore back to our accommodation in Glenridding.Day 7: Sunbiggin Tarn to Kirkby Stephen. (6.4 miles, +600 feet, -1,000 feet) The day starts with a bus ride to shorten what would otherwise be a 22-mile walk. The hills in this area are gentler and our route less rocky than in the Lake District. After crossing near Rayseat Pike and the lower slopes of Crosby Garret Fell, we will see the site of the prehistoric village of Severals in the valley of Smardale, and the lime kilns on Smardale Fell. We'll continue walking to the old market town of Kirkby Stephen, where we will stay the night.Day 8: Kirkby Stephen to Keld. (12 miles, +1,900 feet, -1,450 feet) We will begin the 1,570-foot climb to Nine Standards Rigg, large cairns dating back to at least pre-18th century. Two important milestones are reached in this section of the walk; we enter Yorkshire Dales National Park, and we cross the watershed of the Pennines at the highest point of the fell -- 2,178 feet. We will descend to Keld for the night.Day 9: Keld to Gunnerside. (8.5 miles, +500 feet, -800 feet) We will follow the course of the River Swale along the valley floor. From Keld we will cross the river by a footbridge near East Gill Force (waterfall) and climb to the ruins of Crackpot Hall (a former lead mining area), then down to the path along the river. There are many old mines in this area, dating back to the 17th and 18th centuries, together with evidence of lead extraction from the Roman time period. Then we walk on to Gunnerside where we meet our bus and ride on to Richmond for a well-deserved rest day.Day 10: Rest day in Richmond, North Yorkshire. Richmond is a large, historic town founded by the Normans in 1071 \u2013- the castle and its keep still dominate the surroundings. The Georgian period, in the late 17th and 18th centuries, marked Richmond\u2019s heyday, with much elegant architecture being erected around its cobbled marketplace, reported to be one of the largest in England. A walking tour is planned in the morning for those who wish to join. The rest of the day is free to explore the many attractions, parks, gardens, or Richmond Castle, or to just wander along the River Swale to Easeby Abbey.Day 11: Swainby to Clay Bank Top. (8.5 miles, +2,200 feet, -1,600 feet) Before our hike begins, our bus will take us for a tour at Mount Grace Priory, a ruined Carthusian monastery dating from 1398. We are now in the North York Moors National Park. Wainwright described the moors as \"unenclosed, uninhabited, remote from industry and noise and free from traffic -- a magnificent territory for the walker.\" We will pass the well-known landmark of the Wainstones on Hasty Bank, and then descend to Clay Bank Top, where we will be met by bus and taken to nearby Great Broughton for a night's stay.Day 12: Clay Bank Top to Lion Inn at Blakey. (9.0 miles, +1,000 feet, -500 feet) As we leave Clay Bank Top, the ground will rise steadily across Urra Moor, the highest point of the North York Moors. There are beautiful views of Bransdale, Farndale (famous for its daffodils in spring), and Rosedale. We will enjoy refreshments in Blakey at the venerable Lion Inn, which dates back to 1553. Our bus will then take us to the North Sea town of Whitby where we will stay our last two nights.Day 13: Whitby to Robin Hood's Bay. (6.5 miles, +1,000 feet, -1,000 feet) Leaving Whitby, we\u2019ll pass the dramatic Whitby Abbey, which inspired Bram Stoker to write Dracula. From there we'll continue along the coast on the Cleveland Way a few miles until we rejoin the Coast-to-Coast track. Today\u2019s walk will take us along the cliff tops overlooking the North Sea and drop us into the picturesque smugglers village of Robin Hood\u2019s Bay, where we will ceremoniously and triumphantly dip our feet in the North Sea, enjoy a walk through the charming and historic village, and have lunch at a seaside pub.

By special\u00a0invitation, we will visit an ancient palace, now an historical monument,\u00a0where our hostess Alessandra will transport us back in time and tell us how\u00a0the locals used to live, eat, pray, and die. She will also explain Gubbio's\u00a0famous \"Ceri Festival\" and what the people from Gubbio are doing to\u00a0protect their cultural identity and traditions. A direct descendent of the first\u00a0person to preserve St. Francis's basilica in Assisi, Alessandra will share the\u00a0history of St. Francis and describe the various trails walked by the saint in\u00a0his lifetime. We will then hike the local mountain, Monte Ingino, and visit the\u00a0St. Ubaldo Monastery. From this point on, we will be on the Franciscan\u00a0Trail. Hiking distance: 4 miles.Day 5: Visiting the highest mountain in Umbria, Monte Cucco, we will enjoy incredible views of surrounding mountains. The\u00a0flower varieties here are diverse and, on a clear day, we may see the\u00a0Adriatic Sea. The park has mineral springs, healthy beech forests, and\u00a0deep caves accessible only to small groups of travelers. It is also home to\u00a0wolves and golden eagles.

The trail winds through a forested canyon and past a small\u00a0stone shrine and chapel that were recently used in filming a movie about\u00a0St. Francis. We\u00a0follow a stream through a rocky area of exposed (calcare) limestone. At the\u00a0end of the hike, it's possible to enjoy time on your own at the unique\u00a0Gubbio shops in the afternoon.Day 8: We will drive by bus to the beautiful hill town of Spello, where we\u00a0will see incredible frescoes and walk through the cobblestone streets. We\u00a0will then go to La Spella church, on top of a hill, to start a very scenic walk\u00a0on the hillsides of Monte Subasio, the mountain of St. Francis. On our way\u00a0back to Gubbio, we will stop at Santa Maria delgi Angeli, a pilgrimage site,\u00a0where a tiny church sits within a large cathedral, all dedicated to St.\u00a0Francis. Hiking distance: 5 miles, 1,000 feet elevation gain.Day 9: Today we explore a mystical abbey and one of the most important\u00a0monasteries in Italy. Surrounded by chestnut trees and wildlife diversity, the\u00a0Fonte Avellana was an important learning center at the time of St. Francis.\u00a0It is regarded today as the place where \"history was remembered\" by\u00a0monks who worked long hours transcribing ancient documents. Hiking\u00a0distance: 3 miles, 1,500 feet elevation gain.Day 10: Moving from Umbria to Tuscany, the region of Italy that's most\u00a0familiar to Americans, we will visit Trasimeno Lake, part of Trasimeno Park,\u00a0which is also home to the Oasi Naturalistica La Valle, a bird sanctuary and\u00a0environmental research center.

About 1.25 million years ago, a spectacular volcanic eruption, 500 times greater than Mt. St Helens, created the 13.7-mile-wide circular depression now known as the Valles Caldera. Valles Caldera is in the Jemez Mountains of northern New Mexico. It is the world\u2019s best example of a resurgent caldera -- a circular volcano with an uplifted center floor, Redondo Peak. The rim of the caldera is around 10,500 feet and the grass valleys have a base level of 8,700 feet. The preserve is known for its huge mountain meadows, abundant wildlife, and meandering streams. The valleys are grasslands, while the mountains are covered with coniferous forest and aspens--EXPANDFROMHERE--. New Mexico\u2019s largest herds of elk migrate through the caldera. Deer, black bear, and mountain lions are present but almost never seen. The bird watching is good in the valleys with year-round raptor residence.We will be staying at YMCA Camp Shaver. The cabins are open-air cabins that are not heated or equipped with electricity, but there is a bathhouse with eight showers with hot and cold water.\u00a0 We will have breakfast and dinner in the dining hall, but we will pack lunches to take with us to the work sites. Our stay in Valles Caldera will be after the passing of the monsoon rains of late summer.\u00a0 In May we can expect the temperatures to range from 42 to 77 degrees F, and rainfall is an average of 0.91 inches.Come and join us in this new National Park for some meaningful volunteer service work while staying in unique and beautiful New Mexico high country.The ProjectTrout and native fish populations in the Valles Caldera National Preserve have undergone extreme fluctuations following the large wildfires in 2011 and 2013. Long-term population monitoring of fisheries have tracked the post-fire abrupt decline of trout populations and the accompanying increase in native non-game fish (due to the elimination of the predatory brown trout); recent data indicate that the trout populations are rebounding, and the native non-game fish populations are declining to pre-fire levels. Sierra Club volunteers will assist Valles Caldera biologists in sampling streams on the preserve using electro-shocking units to live-capture, measure, and release fish at numerous permanent stream monitoring locations across the preserve. Fish data, combined with data on aquatic invertebrates and water quality, are used by preserve staff to manage fisheries and track the changes in post-fire stream ecosystem health.We will be picked up at YMCA each morning by our field staff and taken by van to the various monitoring sites. We will be divided into three groups, each with a biologist.

This corner of the Colorado Plateau lives up to those images and much, much more. Three hundred million years ago, the one-kilometer-thick salt layer, deposited by the alternate filling and drying of immense seas, began to move upward under great pressure. This caused the upper layers of sandstone to buckle and break, leaving fins -- those upended slabs in which the arches form. Combine these fantastic rock formations with the high desert vegetation of sage, pinion, and juniper and you have a world that invites you to stop and think, to feel your place in the universe, and be at peace. However, the dramatic increase in the number of visitors has brought equally dramatic problems to this one-of-a-kind park.This year, we hope to continue a tradition of highly successful service trips to this park. Our work will take us to scenes of stunning beauty that need immediate attention if we are to preserve them for the future. We will have the satisfaction of knowing that our urgently needed work has contributed to the beauty and preservation of Arches National Park.The ProjectAll winter long, the National Park Service keeps a \u201cwish list,\u201d and waits for Sierra Club volunteers to return in the spring, when we work directly with Park Service staff on projects that have the highest priority at the time. This wish list may include trail work, fencing, removal of exotic vegetation, and other maintenance projects. Assignments are posted and crews rotated, so no one should be bored. Although no experience is required, common sense, good humor, and a good attitude are mandatory. Our rule on these trips is that everything we do is necessary, and whatever we complete is sufficient. Everyone should leave with a sense of accomplishment.To help the Park Service staff direct our efforts most efficiently, all participants are urged to advise the leader of special skills or interests, e.g., carpentry or masonry, operating small tools, graphics and photography, a temperament for detail work, a preference to begin a task and follow it through to completion.

That would be the Yampa River, and it is at its wildest in May and June when it swells with runoff from the high mountain snowpack. The Yampa flows out of the mountains of north-central Colorado and into the canyon country of Dinosaur National Monument, through 2,000-foot-high golden cliffs and wooded canyons carved by rain, snow, frost, and wind. From our launch at Deerlodge Park to its confluence with the Green River at Echo Park, the Yampa roars 46 miles through exciting rapids and a colorful canyon maze cutting deep into the Blue Mountain plateau. It then meets the Green River and we continue 31 miles through more canyons to the departure point. The Yampa\u2019s natural stream flow pattern and protected canyons are home to some of the last remaining healthy populations of river fishes and other rare wildlife. Above the river, desert bighorn sheep dance high on the cliffs, while eagles ride the currents in soft, circular patterns and peregrine falcons make dives for prey at blistering speed. There are miles of sheer, white and black tiger-striped walls, side-canyon waterfalls and 800-year-old Indian rock art--EXPANDFROMHERE--.Because it maintains much of its historic free-flowing stream pattern, the Yampa offers the thrill of running a truly wild river. Our rafts will plunge through many Class III-plus rapids, including Teepee and Big Joe. But the biggest challenge comes from a rapid that was born in 1965. One early evening that June, a huge flash flood carried tons of rock, mud, and boulders down Warm Springs Draw to the river, blocking the narrow river channel. Within 24 hours the Yampa took aim and breached the natural dam, leaving in its wake the Warm Springs Rapid, now rated as one of the \"10 Big Drops\" in the West. Hold on tight: Warm Springs during high runoff can be a Class IV rapid!At Echo Park, the Yampa joins the Green River, flowing south out of the Gates of Lodore. \"The Green is greatly increased by the Yampa,\" wrote Major John Wesley Powell in 1869. \"All this volume is set eddying and spinning in whirlpools, and the waters waltz through the canyon.\" \u00a0We will make a lengthy stop at Jones Hole to explore its clear trout stream, waterfalls, and spectacular Fremont Indian rock art. On our last day, we'll run the truly remarkable Split Mountain Gorge, where the river has cut through the mountain instead of going around it. We will try to solve the puzzle that has troubled geologists for years: How did the river run directly into, rather than around, this mountain range? At this point, the canyon walls close in, and the river picks up speed. This is one of the Green's steepest stretches, with the river dropping 20 feet per mile. These last 10 miles will make for an exciting, raucous, and spectacular end to a fabulous trip!Sturdy 18-foot, oar-powered rafts will accompany our trip, each guided by an experienced, licensed river guide. \u00a0Also, several inflatable kayaks will be \u201cshared\u201d among participants, which, with minimal instruction, will allow you to play in the river on your own, except in the largest rapids. If you wish to participate by paddling, an all-paddle boat can be added if a sufficient number of trip members wish to do so.

It is part of Coronado National Forest. This pristine sky island\u2019s highest point is Chiricahua Peak at 9,797 feet. The Wilderness adjoins the Chiricahua National Monument, which has some of the most spectacular geology in the southwestern United States--EXPANDFROMHERE--. \u00a0The 1.8-million-acre Coronado National Forest (CNF) covers 12 of the 57 noncontiguous mountain ranges known as sky islands that form an archipelago in the sea of desert and grassland spreading across the American Southwest. The land under CNF administration is some of the most ecologically rich in the nation; forests of ponderosa pine, spruce, fir, and aspen typical of the Rockies and Sierra Madre slope upward from pincushions of Sonora and Chihuahua Desert saguaros and scrub. The Coronado is also inhabited by many radically diverse species.Unlike most of the other 154 national forests, CNF was not a big source of merchantable timber when Teddy Roosevelt declared it a national forest, along with others, in July 1908, during his 24-hour flurry of executive orders to conserve public land natural resources. The Coronado\u2019s mountains were then and are still vital as a watershed, contributing to southeast Arizona\u2019s groundwater supply. Wildlife preservation, cattle grazing, and recreation have been the CNF\u2019s traditional uses. (1)\u00a0Southeastern Arizona is a birding \u201chot spot\u201d and is the southern-most range for many North American species and the northern-most range for many Central\/South American bird species. Our service trip will be during the spring migration when many Central\/South American birds will be heading northward for the summer. You will also have the opportunity to potentially view a variety of wildlife, including black bear, mountain lions, white-tail and mule deer, coatis, and many varieties of birds, especially hummingbirds.The Chiricahua Mountains also have a rich Native American history. \u00a0Due to its rugged terrain, the Chiricahuas provided the Apaches with a place of refuge during the 1860s and 1870s. Before his demise, the legendary Chiricahua Apache, Geronimo, participated in a number of revenge attacks against the Mexicans for the murder of his family members, becoming a hunted man by the Mexican Army and eventually the U.S. Army. After evading thousands of Mexican and American troops, Geronimo and his band of Apaches were eventually overwhelmed by a relentless pursuit.The ProjectFollowing Geronimo\u2019s footsteps, we will maintain trails utilizing only hand tools, since this is a wilderness area where no power tools are permitted.Our work schedule will include four workdays and a free day to explore the area. It is likely that we will work on trails within three miles of our camp or a trailhead, but we can count on substantial hiking every day.We will work in a mixed conifer forest\u2014primarily ponderosa pine and Douglas fir\u2014but we will also see white fir, aspen, and the southernmost stand of Englemann spruce in North America. At lower elevations, there is a great variety of oak species, Chiricahua and pinion pine, and juniper.Due to severe weather and some devastating fires, there is an enormous amount of deadfall in this area. Much of our work will be clearing brush and also cutting logs with two-person crosscut saws to enable us to remove them from the trail. Some of these logs may be over 30 inches thick! Other tasks include repairing tread, repairing signs, and clearing brush. Tools we will use include: crosscut saws and coronas, Pulaskis, McLeods, loppers, and hand axes. The work will be both physically demanding and rewarding. There will be a suitable job(s) for everyone and everyone can work at his or her own pace. A ranger from the U.S. Forest Service will guide our work and train us in the safe use of the tools.

That would be the Yampa River, and it is at its wildest in May and June when it swells with runoff from the high mountain snowpack. The Yampa flows out of the mountains of north-central Colorado and into the canyon country of Dinosaur National Monument, through 2,000-foot-high golden cliffs and wooded canyons carved by rain, snow, frost, and wind. From our launch at Deerlodge Park to its confluence with the Green River at Echo Park, the Yampa roars 46 miles through exciting rapids and a colorful canyon maze cutting deep into the Blue Mountain plateau. It then meets the Green River and we continue 31 miles through more canyons to the departure point. The Yampa\u2019s natural stream flow pattern and protected canyons are home to some of the last remaining healthy populations of river fishes and other rare wildlife. Above the river, desert bighorn sheep dance high on the cliffs, while eagles ride the currents in soft, circular patterns and peregrine falcons make dives for prey at blistering speed. There are miles of sheer, white and black tiger-striped walls, side-canyon waterfalls and 800-year-old Indian rock art--EXPANDFROMHERE--.Because it maintains much of its historic free-flowing stream pattern, the Yampa offers the thrill of running a truly wild river. Our rafts will plunge through many Class III-plus rapids, including Teepee and Big Joe. But the biggest challenge comes from a rapid that was born in 1965. One early evening that June, a huge flash flood carried tons of rock, mud, and boulders down Warm Springs Draw to the river, blocking the narrow river channel. Within 24 hours the Yampa took aim and breached the natural dam, leaving in its wake the Warm Springs Rapid, now rated as one of the \"10 Big Drops\" in the West. Hold on tight: Warm Springs during high runoff can be a Class IV rapid!At Echo Park, the Yampa joins the Green River, flowing south out of the Gates of Lodore. \"The Green is greatly increased by the Yampa,\" wrote Major John Wesley Powell in 1869. \"All this volume is set eddying and spinning in whirlpools, and the waters waltz through the canyon.\" \u00a0We will make a lengthy stop at Jones Hole to explore its clear trout stream, waterfalls, and spectacular Fremont Indian rock art. On our last day, we'll run the truly remarkable Split Mountain Gorge, where the river has cut through the mountain instead of going around it. We will try to solve the puzzle that has troubled geologists for years: How did the river run directly into, rather than around, this mountain range? At this point, the canyon walls close in, and the river picks up speed. This is one of the Green's steepest stretches, with the river dropping 20 feet per mile. These last 10 miles will make for an exciting, raucous, and spectacular end to a fabulous trip!Sturdy 18-foot, oar-powered rafts will accompany our trip, each guided by an experienced, licensed river guide. \u00a0Also, several inflatable kayaks will be \u201cshared\u201d among participants, which, with minimal instruction, will allow you to play in the river on your own, except in the largest rapids.

Our final destination for today is the seaside village of Camogli, where we will stay the next three nights.Day 6: (Portofino to San Fruttuoso)\u00a0A short bus ride takes us to the seaside village of Santa Margarita where we board our boat to\u00a0Portofino. Its breathtaking views and wonderful location transformed this fishing village into a tourist destination and the center of the summer\u2019s\u00a0dolce vita,\u00a0attracting countless writers, poets, painters, and movie stars. We will start hiking from the center of the village to the beautiful San Fruttuoso Abbey, built in the 11th century. From San Fruttuoso, we will take a boat back to Camogli to enjoy more of this beautiful coast. Hiking time: three and a half hours, with 1,000 feet of elevation gain. Here we will have another opportunity to swim in the Italian Riviera or tour the Abbey. Dinner is on your own tonight.Day 7: (San Rocco to Punta Chiappa)\u00a0Starting from the beautiful church of San Rocco di Camogli, 900 feet above Camogli, we have a pleasant, mostly downhill hike to the promontory of Punta Chiappa, which ends with a short boat ride back to Camogli. As a special treat, we will take the bus to Genoa for an historic walking tour of this fabulous city of World Heritage sites. After that we'll return for our last night in Camogli. Hiking time: two hours, with modest elevation gain.Day 8: (Capo Manara)\u00a0A 30-minute bus ride takes us to beautiful Sestri Levante, a village between the Baia del Silenzio (Bay of Silence) and Baia delle Favole (Bay of Fairy Tales). We will hike through a protected area on a trail sided by beautiful Aleppo Pines and Cork Oaks, a perfect combination with the expansive sea views. We will reach Punta Manara for more great views. After lunch we will have time to enjoy the lively city center or spend some time on the beach before we head for Noli and our hotel for the next two nights. Hiking time: two and a half hours, with 750 feet of elevation gain. We will have a one and a half hour bus ride to our Noli hotel after the hike.Day 9: (Noli to Varigotti hike)\u00a0Today\u2019s hike follows an ancient mule road that connected the villages of Noli and Varigotti before the modern route was built. We will walk past the Saraceni beach and the lovely church of San Lorenzo to reach Varigotti -- passing typical Mediterranean vegetation, including rosemary and arbutus plants -- and get to the dramatic cape viewpoint over vertical Triassic limestone cliffs. Our walk ends in Varigotti. After lunch we will bus back to Noli, which is part of the \u201cMost Beautiful Villages in Italy\u201d network. Hiking time: four hours, with about 1,300 feet of elevation gain.Day 10: (Bussana Vecchia and Menton, France)\u00a0A bus ride of one and a half hours takes us to our trailhead. Our hike this morning takes us to the ancient village of Bussana Vecchia. This medieval village was probably founded by the Romans and inhabited until 1887, when a violent earthquake hit it. At the end of the 1950s, artists from all over the world established a vital community based on ideals of common property and inspirational creativity. After a pleasant lunch in Bussana Vecchia, we drive 30 minutes toward the French border, stopping at a botanic garden for a refreshing break.

What makes safari\u00a0so fascinating is taking the time to observe the animal behavior and interaction. We'll see different\u00a0animals in the floodplains of Savuti. In addition to those named in the first three days, there are\u00a0sitatunga, crocodile, hippo, and otter. Birds of the wetlands include different storks,\u00a0flamingos, bee-eaters, hornbills, and various geese, along with predators such as eagles,\u00a0hawks, vultures, owls, and others. This area has over 350 bird species and the most interesting human history in the region. Around the evening campfire, our guides will tell\u00a0these stories as well as answer our questions about the animal behaviors we have\u00a0observed during the day.\u00a0Days 9-10: We'll move farther north to the waterfront of Chobe National Park. This park, which borders Namibia, Zambia, and Zimbabwe, is a good bit larger than Connecticut. It\u00a0encompasses a wide variety of terrain, from a lush river region in the north (where\u00a0myriad game come to drink) and unremitting dry bushland in the south. Chobe is famous\u00a0for its herds of elephants. They tramp around everywhere -- 45,000 are said to make\u00a0Chobe their home. Watching elephants is fascinating, and one cannot help but admire\u00a0these huge, intelligent beasts. Nowhere in Africa can elephants be seen in such numbers\u00a0as in Chobe. In addition to game drives, we take an afternoon river cruise on\u00a0the Chobe River to view animals as they come down to drink before sunset. The light at\u00a0this time of day is incredible! Of course, this is also the kingdom of the big cats and\u00a0hippos, as well as many species of antelope.\u00a0Days 11-12: After bidding good-bye to our safari guides, we\u2019ll cross the\u00a0Zimbabwe border and drive through Zambezi National Park to Victoria Falls. The falls, which\u00a0are known as The Smoke That Thunders, are a world-famous sight. With a 350-foot drop\u00a0and mile-plus width producing a massive sheet of falling water, they are the largest falls in the world and one of the Seven Natural Wonders of the world -- a real sight to behold! After checking into our hotel, we'll be free to explore the various hiking paths on our own.\u00a0Lunches here are on your own, leaving participants to pursue individual interests.

This tour is an excellent introduction for those who have never visited this most fascinating country and a treat for those experienced travelers who haven\u2019t yet had the chance to walk the charming paths of the Cotswolds region.England may be a small country, but it has a rich historical legacy, which results in a fascinating mix of culture, language, and landscape. On this tour we concentrate on the southern area of this island empire. Southern England\u2019s countryside is gently undulating, with hilly areas in the Cotswolds and farmland between the towns and cities.We begin our trip in Moreton-in-Marsh, a traditional Cotswolds market town dating back 1,000 years. It is on a direct rail line from London. From Moreton-in-Marsh we begin our four-day walk from village to village. We will set a moderate pace of four to seven miles per day wandering up and down the 900-foot limestone Cotswold Escarpment with its tapestry of hills, small acreage farms, and woodlots. We carry only a day pack as we walk over the paths, covering an elevation change of between 200 and 1,000 feet on each day\u2019s walk. Our luggage will be transported from one accommodation to the next.\"Cotswold\" is derived from the Anglo-Saxon \"Cote,\" or sheep fold. \"Wold\" refers to an unfenced tract of land. It is an area rich with evidence of the Iron Age, Celtic, and Roman occupation. Our route crosses ruins of ancient barrows and fortifications dating as far back as 2500 B.C. It passes monuments erected to memorialize military and religious exploits of past native \"sons,\" and winds by estates of wealthy noble families. We will undoubtedly see signs of late spring in the countryside: crops starting to emerge in the fields and lambs frolicking. Every day we walk among rolling hills, fields, villages, gardens, churches, and thatched-roof houses. The route takes us through towns with antique stores, tea rooms, museums, and pubs. We stay at small hotels and B&Bs, sampling the local cuisine and selecting snacks and lunch fare as we pass quaint shops.The beautiful honey-colored stone found in the Cotswolds appears in the houses, barns, and field walls we see along our way. At times we walk on just a path through parkland and pasture as we follow farm roads, with an occasional highway or railroad crossing. Splendid views are to be had from ridges and hilltops. The exceptional natural features of this area have resulted in its designation by the government of the United Kingdom as an \u201cArea of Outstanding Natural Beauty.\u201dFrom the town of Chipping Camden we drive to Shakespeare\u2019s town of birth, Stratford-upon-Avon, for a day\u2019s tour. For those who are interested, there is an optional opportunity to attend a Shakespeare play that evening. Our next stop is Bath, a city famous for its history of Roman and Georgian architecture and its natural thermal springs. It has more protected historic buildings than any other city of its size in England. We spend two nights in Bath with plenty of time to tour the town and visit the recently renovated Roman Baths Museum. There is an opportunity for an optional visit to Thermae Bath Spa, the luxurious warm springs spa in Bath.From Bath we stop at two of the most famous Neolithic sites in the world, Stonehenge and Avebury. As old as the pyramids, these stone circles amazed medieval Europeans and continue to amaze modern travelers. We will walk around these structures that are full of mystery and majesty. We end our trip in London for our last night\u2019s farewell dinner and depart for home the following morning.\u00a0","highlights":"Walk through the picturesque Cotswolds, Explore storybook villages, Roman ruins & lush gardens, Enjoy tours of Bath, Stratford-upon-Avon & Stonehenge","includes":"  Local guides specializing in history, culture & nature,   Tours of regional gardens & a medieval castle,   All accommodations in country inns and small hotels    ","itinerary":"The itinerary is subject to change based on weather or other factors.Day 1: We meet at our historic inn in Moreton-in-Marsh for an orientation session, then begin our first walk of seven miles to Stow.

We return in the afternoon to overnight at our inn in Moreton-in-Marsh. Tonight a local historian will give us a slide show on the history of the Cotswolds.Day 2: After breakfast we transfer to Bibury and take a six-mile circular walk. Lunch will be at a hotel or picnic if the weather permits. We visit the Cotswold Woolen Weavers Centre in the afternoon. Tonight we will enjoy a slide show on the famous artists and writers of the Cotswolds.Day 3: We transfer to the picturesque village of Guiting Power and walk through woods and fields to the ancient Saxon capital of Winchcombe where we tour Sudeley Castle, the last resting place of Katherine Parr, Henry VIII's sixth wife.

Bath\u2019s Georgian terraces, crowned by the magnificent Royal Circus and Royal Crescent, climb dramatically up the hillsides. The historic centre, where the Roman baths and ancient abbey still stand, is in a splendid location by the River Avon. We overnight in Bath.Day 8: Today we tour the local area with our guide in our private bus. We visit Highgrove, home of Prince Charles, and then Lacock village in the afternoon. Lacock Village, dating back to the 13th century, remains largely unchanged over the centuries and has many limewashed, half-timbered, and stone houses. During the Middle Ages Lacock became a prosperous and thriving town through its wool industry. The village was well placed for communications, sited on the \u201ccloth road\u201d from London and the River Avon.\u00a0The village has been preserved and protected from any form of development and is frequently used for TV and film dramas. We return to our lodging in Bath for the evening.Day 9: After breakfast we leave Bath and drive back to London. On our way we stop to tour Stonehenge and Avebury, two of the most famous pre-historic archaeological sites in the world. Stonehenge\u2019s iconic stone circle is as old as the pyramids and still impresses visitors today. Avebury dates to 2800 B.C., older than Stonehenge by six centuries. Its complex of great stones is much larger than Stonehenge\u2019s and more accessible to visitors. Tonight we enjoy our farewell dinner and overnight at our hotel in London.Day 10: After breakfast we take our flights home.","leader1":"Marti Greason","leader2":"","leader3":""}},{"trip":{"title":"Beginner Backpack by the Sea, Point Reyes National Seashore, California","id":"18141A","dates":"Jun 10, 2018 to Jun 16, 2018","destination":"United States, California","type":"Backpack","group":"Beginners","difficulty":"2 (out of 5)","priceHigh":"675","priceLow":"675","image":{"src":"https:\/\/content.sierraclub.org\/outings\/sites\/content.sierraclub.org.outings\/files\/styles\/trip-teaser\/public\/trips\/main-images\/17145_1_CarolReeb.jpg?itok=odLzOHHc","alt":""},"path":"\/outings\/beginner-backpack-point-reyes-california#trip=18141A","overview":"The Trip\u201cAt the edge of the sea, life first came to the land and comes still; comes to the [one] who rests there unhurried, who pauses to learn what belongs there, to enjoy it for what it is.\u201d-\u00a0Harold Gilliam, Island In Time, 1962.Have you ever wanted to take a trip into the wilderness with a pack on your back, the camaraderie of new friends, great food, and a chance to learn about the natural history of one of California\u2019s most picturesque coastlines?\u00a0 If so, this beginner\u2019s backpacking trip to Pt.

Prior to the mid 1800s, these magnificent animals roamed in large herds across much of California.\u00a0 However, unregulated hunting and displacement by cattle caused numbers to decline. By 1870, the species was thought to be extinct. Fortunately, a few survived and in 1976, 10 animals were reintroduced to Pt. Reyes. Today, that small herd has grown to over 400, creating new concerns for their management. After lunch, we will return to the trailhead to find another path descending through ancient Ice Age sand dunes to beautiful McClures Beach. Hidden among boulders of this photogenic cove are some of California\u2019s oldest rocks (called Gneiss).\u00a0 Formed deep in the earth under extreme pressure, the surreal patterns trapped in stone suggest the work of an artist. Returning to camp, we will cook dinner, check our gear, weigh packs, and prepare for our first day of backpacking in the morning. Total hiking distance will be 7-8 miles.Day 3: After breakfast, we'll make final pack adjustments then head out on our first day of backpacking. Our trek requires us to climb 1,300 feet up Inverness Ridge. Some may want to take a side trip to the top of Mt. Wittenberg before we settle in at Sky Camp. In the evening, we'll enjoy panoramic views high above Drakes Bay. We might imagine what it was like, so long ago, high atop this ridge when Sir Frances Drake first rowed ashore in 1579 to claim the land in the name of England's queen. Or perhaps we might imagine a more desperate scene when a Spanish galleon, the San Agustin, was shipwrecked in this bay, leaving behind treasures for others to find. Total hiking distance will be three miles.Day 4: Today, we\u2019ll hike mostly downhill to our next campsite and arrive to set up tents by early afternoon. There should be plenty of free time to relax, walk along the beach, scan the horizon for migrating whales, or explore tide pools before they are washed over by a late afternoon tide.

Marvel at towering rock walls where clusters of native plants cling precariously by their delicate roots and decorate the ancient stones. Explore sea caves and tide pools and hike to Bass Lake after lunch. Or simply relax on the beach.

The training lasts for approximately six months. During the first five months, each trainee designs, plans, and submits his\/her own National Outing and then develops a meal plan and practices screening participants for that trip--EXPANDFROMHERE--. This work is done by the trainee at home and under the guidance of a mentor. The training then culminates in five days of hands-on training in the field under the direction of several trainers.This website provides a picture of what this training is about, who should apply, what to expect, plus lots more. In applying for this trip, you will be putting yourself in the company of a dedicated group of volunteer leaders offering some of the best outings in the world. There\u2019s a lot of information here.

The skills you learn during this trip will apply equally for the different types of National and International Outings that you may choose to lead: backpack, lodge, basecamp, water trips, or multi-sport trips. During the training, trainees will:Design and submit (using the National Outings Trip Submission System) an engaging and fiscally realistic outing that furthers the conservation mission of the Sierra Club.Write an engaging brochure that will effectively sell the trip.Plan an appetizing and accommodating menu.Conduct pre-trip interviews with mock sign-ups and accept appropriate participants for the outing.Participate fully in the field section of the training, both as a participant and leader-of- the-day.Demonstrate safety awareness, sound judgment and decision-making as part of the leader-of-the-day team.Demonstrate professional communication skills and maintain professional working relationships with home school mentor, field trainers, fellow trainees and leader-of- the-day leader throughout all of NOTT (home school and field training).Demonstrate the ability to manage all logistical aspects of a full day on a backpacking trip. This includes Leave No Trace, route finding, hazard assessment, and group energy level assessment, etc.\u00a0About National OutingsWith more than 100 years of wilderness travel experience, and as a part of the largest grassroots conservation organization in the country, Sierra Club Outings offers more than 350 trips annually to unique destinations around the world. We aim to provide a variety of quality outdoor adventures for people of all ages. Our offerings include adventures in the U.S., Canada, and abroad, including backpacking, base camping, canoeing, kayaking, bicycling, rafting, sailing, skiing, snowshoeing, day hiking, service trips, lodge trips, and family vacations; domestic trips are generally 5\u201310 days in length, while international trips may last up to three weeks. National Outings provides services to about 4,000 participants per year. The 350 trips per year are led by approximately 500 volunteer leaders supported by a small staff in the Outings Department at the Club\u2019s headquarters in Oakland, California. Trips are priced for the program to operate on a long-term, break-even basis.The Ideal of Being a National Outings Leader: The opportunity to follow John Muir\u2019s example and inspire someone to make huge strides in protecting the natural world. The chance to share a remote, pristine, inspiring spot in the wilderness. At parties, you get to say \u201cYes, I\u2019m a leader for the world\u2019s oldest, largest and most effective environmental organization: The Sierra Club.\u201dThe Reality of being a National Outings Leader: Actually, these ideals can be the reality. However, the adage \u201cthere\u2019s no free ride\u201d is especially true. Becoming a volunteer leader for Sierra Club Outings takes loads of lead time, commitment, and training. For more than 100 years, we\u2019ve been offering wilderness trips, led by dedicated volunteers, to educate people about the need for protection of natural resources, and we\u2019ve developed procedures to ensure our trips are safe and successful. We\u2019re dependent on these volunteers, who are organized into subcommittees that are responsible for all offerings in their geographic area or their type of trip. For example, there are subcommittees for California backpacking, for the Southwest, for Alaska, and for Water trips in the West. There are 18 different committees in all, and many have their own set of special qualifications or requirements for leadership and for approval of proposed outings. While undeniably a lot of work, you\u2019ll find the rewards far exceed your efforts. Our training trip will take you through the process step by step, and give you lots of hands-on experiences and case studies to improve your skills and help you gain confidence.Upon successful completion, there are additional measures to ensure you\u2019re not thrown into a sink-or-swim situation. You may become a trainee or assistant on a trip and work with an experienced leader who will mentor you and provide answers to your questions about setting up a successful, enjoyable, safe, AND inspirational outing.CurriculumWe will cover the following curricula:Working with the office staff and volunteer leadershipTrip PlanningSafety ManagementParticipant Welcoming and Pre-Trip ScreeningInterpersonal Leadership SkillsGroup ManagementDecision Making and Problem SolvingWilderness Emergency ManagementNutrition and Food PlanningConservation through OutingsCultural History of the area we are travelling inNatural History of the area we are travelling inEquipment and Clothing SelectionHealth and Sanitation & HygieneCommon Medical Problems and PreventionLightening Safety and PreparednessLeave No TraceWater Purification & How-ToWeather and Weather Prediction","highlights":"Learn how to plan your own Sierra Club National Outing, Grow skills and self-confidence in outdoor leadership, Enjoy 4 days backpacking Rocky Mountain National Park","includes":"  Training in backpacking skills, esp. for high altitude ,   Transport to\/from the Denver airport,   An Individualized Leadership Development Plan","itinerary":"Home SchoolOnce you have been accepted onto the trip (after registering for the training, submitting an application, and participating in 2-3 interviews), you should begin to complete the homework assignments. There is considerable work to be done before the field section.80% of the work is in the planning and preparation and 20% is in the actual field time. The\u00a0homework phase of the training takes 40-60 hours of time during the 5 months prior to the field trip, with deadlines specifically planned to meet volunteer\/staff leadership and Sierra magazine schedules. The training is conducted in the same way you will plan your future National outing:Due 5 Months before the Field Trip: Trip Expression of Interest, Title and CopyYou will work with your Home School Mentor to decide on the overarching trip plan you are considering. Your Home School Mentor will \"approve\" your outing in the same way that your National Outings Subcommittee Chair would. Additionally, you will craft your trip title and 30-60 word trip copy (for Sierra magazine).Due \u00a04 Months before the Field Trip: Trip BudgetNow you will organize and plan out the actual costs of your trip in addition to finalizing your 30-60 word trip copy. You will submit this information using our online trip submission system and receive your trip budget with feedback from your mentor.Due 3 Months before the Field Trip: Trip BrochureYou will now have the chance to write the online trip brochure (same format as this one) for your trip. Your homework mentor will work with you to refine your drafts.Due 2 Months before the Field Trip: Food PlanningPlanning healthy and exciting meals for your mock trip is the most challenging step for most new leaders. You will have the chance to work with your homework mentor to develop and refine your menu, recipe document, and shopping list.Due 1 Month before the Field Trip: Participant Welcoming & Pre-Trip ScreeningDuring this final homework step, you will welcome and screen at least two mock trip participants for your trip and decide whether to accept them or not.Due shortly before the Field Trip: Leader of the Day (LOD) PlanningYou will spend time with your LOD partner(s) to discuss how you two will work \u00a0together on the field trip during your one day of leadership. This will be guided by a \u201cGetting Acquainted\u201d exercise that many leaders find helpful when working with someone new. Other planning tasks include drafting a Safety Management Plan for your designed trip and planning, buying, packing and bringing to food for the group on your LOD day. Upon training completion you will be reimbursed for the food costs in the same way that trip leaders are.Field TripThe field trip is an immersion in Sierra Club best practices. Three veteran trainers will guide eight prospective leaders through all aspects of planning, preparing, and leading national outings. Although this is backpacking training, lessons learned are appropriate to all Sierra Club trips. Regardless of the style of Sierra Club trip you want to lead, this trip is for you.During each of four days in the field, two trainees will be Leaders of the Day, responsible for all aspects of the day, from safety management to morale. The days are long and full, and the trip is physically and mentally demanding. You will receive ongoing verbal\u00a0feedback while hiking, at a nightly debrief, in a personal development plan at the end of the trip, and in a close relationship with other Sierra Club leaders in the years ahead.The goal is to build your skills and leadership, and to ensure ongoing support through mentors and other Sierra Club resources, so that you are confident and comfortable to lead Sierra Club trips to help others Explore, Enjoy and Protect the Planet.After Home School and Field TripWhat the trainers will do: Upon successful completion of this training, the trainers will submit a \"Training Trip and Trainee Summary\" (based on everyone\u2019s Leadership Development Plans) to each of the 18 subcommittee chairs who manage the 350 outings each year. Specific subcommittee staffing decisions are made by the subcommittee chair, not the Home School Mentors or Field Trainers. This summary will include a description of the training, what your strengths and areas of growth are, what subcommittees you are interested in, and what leadership role the trainers feel you are ready for (e.g. trainee, assistant, provisional leader, or needing more technical or leadership experience).What you will do: You will receive a written Leadership Development Plan during your development plan meeting. This will highlight what you do well, what you need to work on, which subcommittees you might fit best in, and what roles these might be (based on your interests). About one month after the training trip, you should contact the subcommittee chairs (allowing them time to receive and digest the Training Trip Summary) to express your interest in leading and determining your next step. \u00a0Your placements will be based on your specific skill set, training trip performance and your time availability. We will also do our best to take into consideration your desired geographic location and\/or activity type.","leader1":"Becky Wong","leader2":"Shelly Eberly","leader3":"Roger Grissette"}},{"trip":{"title":"In the Shadow of the Alps: Light Hiking and Culture in Italy and France","id":"18655A","dates":"Jun 13, 2018 to Jun 24, 2018","destination":"Europe, Italy, France","type":"International","group":"","difficulty":"","priceHigh":"4295","priceLow":"4295","image":{"src":"https:\/\/content.sierraclub.org\/outings\/sites\/content.sierraclub.org.outings\/files\/styles\/trip-teaser\/public\/trips\/main-images\/18655_22_GeneGoldberg.jpg?itok=4pPIASqn","alt":""},"path":"\/outings\/national\/brochure\/shadow-alps-light-hiking-and-culture-italy-and-france#trip=18655A","overview":"The TripNorthern Italy and nearby France have been home to humans for tens of thousands of years.

We'll be investigating all of these -- primarily the petroglyphs, with a little bit of the rest -- and, of course, contemporary life, culture, conservation, and food--EXPANDFROMHERE--. \u00a0We meet near Milan and go directly to the Val Camonica, a UNESCO site inhabited for millennia and containing thousands of petroglyphs.\u00a0 After a day and a half in this low mountain environment, we go on to Lake Como for two days to cruise on the lake, and visit a castle, some villages, and a beautiful villa with its awesome botanic garden.\u00a0 We then visit several small villages in a wide variety of landscapes, including lakes, mountains, hills, and seaside. We will take moderate walks in these varied terrains, stopping at organic farms, visiting a castle, and delving into prehistoric cave sites.\u00a0Next we go the Piemonte region to hike in the hills and visit organic farms, wineries, and local cheese producers.\u00a0 After two days here, we continue on to Finale Ligure, a seaside village in a less frequented part of Italy. Our two days here include hiking with views of the sea and visiting prehistoric caves.Moving on to France, we will spend two days in Valee des Merveilles (Valley of Wonders), visiting some more prehistoric sites with petroglyphs and enjoying beautiful mountain views. Finally, we drive to the French coastline, where we will enjoy visiting coastal villages, and we end our trip in Nice.","highlights":"See seldom-visited prehistoric sites, Enjoy beautiful Lake Como, Tour a castle and small villages","includes":"  All lodging in hotels and all meals,   Full-time English-speaking guide,   On-trip transportation and all gratuities","itinerary":"The following is our planned itinerary; changes may be made due to weather, closures, or other unforeseen events, but we will try to include as much of the mentioned activities and sites as possible.\u00a0Day 1:\u00a0We meet this morning at a hotel near Milan's Malpensa Airport. You can stay the night before at the hotel or you can bus out from the city.\u00a0 We encourage you to arrive in the Milan area a day or two early to overcome jet lag and allow any delayed baggage the chance to catch up to you.\u00a0 After an orientation meeting, we board the charter bus we'll be using for the trip and transfer to the Val Camonica. Leaving our baggage at the hotel, we take a short, easy walk amongst some of the petroglyphs found throughout the area--EXPANDFROMHERE--.\u00a0Day 2:\u00a0Today we make a more extensive exploration of the petroglyphs while enjoying the beautiful scenery.\u00a0 Walking will be easy, and the pace will allow for studying what we see. Val Camonica is on the UNESCO World Heritage list owing to the presence of one of the world's greatest collections of prehistoric petroglyphs -- more than 140,000 symbols and figures carved in the rock over a period of 8,000 years, depicting themes connected with agriculture, navigation, war, and magic. We will rediscover the most significant and meaningful ones on this very special exploration.\u00a0Day 3:\u00a0We begin today with a transfer to Lake Como, one of Italy's largest lakes and one of the most beautiful sights in Italy.\u00a0 Breathtaking views will be our background today, offering an incredible combination of colors and shapes: the blue of the water and the sky, the green of the trees, the majesty of the villas and gardens with silhouettes of their ancient statues overlooking the water.\u00a0 Here we hike along a path overlooking the lake and end our day at the ruins of Castle Vezio, where we may attend an interesting falconry training program, weather permitting.Day 4:\u00a0Taking full advantage of our lake stay, we will walk, ride a local ferry, explore pretty Bellagio, and visit beautiful Villa Carlotta with its 17-acre botanical garden. The villa itself is a very special museum that houses, among others, masterpieces by the sculptor Canova and the painter Hayez. The setting is extremely interesting as it is all in a 17th-century building, splendidly refurbished by the eccentric\u00a0Giovanni Battista Sommariva, whose mysterious fortune was tightly tied to Napoleon. The garden is especially known for azaleas and\u00a0rhododendrons.Day 5:\u00a0Again boarding our bus, we transfer to the Piemonte (Piedmont) region.\u00a0 Piemonte means \u201cat the feet of the mountains,\u201d referring to the neighboring Alps. Some of the best wine in Italy is produced here, where vintners have been working for many years at developing sustainable farming of high-quality vineyards. Our hike through the vineyards will be scenic and informative, as we learn more about the different varietals planted here and how the soil influences the flavors and properties of the grapes, and ultimately the wine.\u00a0 We can also sample some of the wines at a family-owned winery, where we will also learn about family ties and traditions.Day 6:\u00a0We'll take a longer walk today, meandering through the farmlands and stopping for lunch at an organic cheese farm, where they also raise their own sheep and grind their own grains for the bread. The owner is a very special character who will explain how he wants to become fully self-sustainable.\u00a0 We will learn about Slow Food, a movement started nearby in 1986 when Carlo Petrini founded a non-profit association to support and promote the local food and flavors so tied to local culture and traditions. If we still have energy after the walk and lunch, we can visit a small village and castle.Day 7:\u00a0Today we move to the Finale Ligure area, a less visited corner of Italy, but surely one of the most beautiful parts of the Riviera. We'll take a hike, enjoying views over the sea along the way, to visit the charming and colorful village of Final Borgo with its interesting archaeological museum, and then end the day near Sanremo. Time permitting, we may also jump in the ocean for a refreshing swim!Day 8:\u00a0We start today with a visit to the Toirano caves, where\u00a0traces of prehistoric settlements and 10,000 year-old footprints have been found.\u00a0We will then hike in the environs of the village of Triora, famous for its witch trials\u00a0100\u00a0years before Salem's. We will learn more about the trials and the Inquisition, and look for some of the places where the so-called witches used to meet. We will then return to our lodging near Sanremo.\u00a0Day 9:\u00a0Saying arrivederci to Italy, we drive into France, where we settle into new lodgings in the Vallee des Merveilles. It will be a very dramatic change of scenery as we will definitely be in the mountains today. Short walks take us to a few of the many rock art sites here.Day 10:\u00a0We continue exploring the valley today. More than 30,000 petroglyphs have been found and catalogued after their first discovery in the 19th\u00a0century by the amateur archaeologist, Clarence Bicknell.\u00a0We will make our most difficult hike of the trip (7 miles, +\/-2,200 feet) up a mountain trail to meet a park ranger for a tour of the most famous ones, which depict horned animals, daggers, axes, suns, stars, spirals, and other symbols, which we will try to decipher.Day 11:\u00a0Transferring to Nice, we have options today to explore the town and enjoy some of the pretty villages of the coast, or to take a last hike in the hills overlooking the Mediterranean Sea before our farewell dinner.\u00a0Day 12:\u00a0The trip ends after breakfast with a transfer to Nice's airport.","leader1":"Shlomo Waser","leader2":"","leader3":""}},{"trip":{"title":"Yellowstone and Grand Teton Adventure for Women, Wyoming","id":"18222A","dates":"Jun 16, 2018 to Jun 23, 2018","destination":"United States, Wyoming","type":"Kayak, Raft","group":"Women","difficulty":"","priceHigh":"3195","priceLow":"3195","image":{"src":"https:\/\/content.sierraclub.org\/outings\/sites\/content.sierraclub.org.outings\/files\/styles\/trip-teaser\/public\/trips\/main-images\/18222_main_OARS.jpg?itok=edTp8NrH","alt":""},"path":"\/outings\/yellowstone-grand-teton-women-wyoming#trip=18222A","overview":"The Trip\"Beside the treasures common to most mountain regions that are wild and blessed with a kind climate, the park is full of exciting wonders.

The largest country in East Africa and situated just south of the equator, Tanzania has a truly magnificent variety of landscapes and 12 national parks that are unsurpassed in beauty and variety. Among its unspoiled savannah one can still find Maasai nomads and millions of wild animals. Tanzania is home to over 40 species of mammals, including elephant, giraffe, cape buffalo, hippo, rhinoceros, zebra, wildebeest, antelope, warthog, lion, cheetah, leopard, hyena, and many more--EXPANDFROMHERE--.\u00a0Tanzania is also a bird watcher's paradise with too many species to list.\u00a0 Who can say which bird is more spectacular? The greater flamingo, secretary bird, crowned crane, lilac-breasted roller, kori bustard, lily trotter, spoonbill stork, marabou stork, the bee eaters, or any of a dozen others.Of all the African wildlife areas, none surpasses Tanzania's for spectacular scenery and number of animals. Our safari takes us from the green foothills of snow-mantled Mount Kilimanjaro (the continent's highest mountain at 19,340 feet); through the limitless expanse of the Serengeti Plain (a World Heritage site) and to the misty Ngoronogoro Crater (the world\u2019s largest intact caldron, which measures 12 miles across). And if these natural wonders are not enough, the trip will also visit historic places like Oldovai Gorge, the site of Leakey's discovery of early human bones, near the very dawn of human existence.The Serengeti National Park\u2019s name is derived from the Maasai language \u201cSiringet,\u201d which means \"endless plains.\" Within an area of 5,700 square miles we\u2019ll find a staggering animal population of about four million, including huge herds of zebra, wildebeest and other grazing animals. Over 350 species of birds and 35 larger mammals can be found here. Each game drive will feature different animals and surprises.\u00a0 The skill and experience of our driver guides will be obvious as they look for animal viewing opportunities.In addition to wildlife observation, this outing also offers opportunities to learn about Tanzania's Maasai ethnic group, and to see a vast cross-section of Tanzania -- the largest country in East Africa and the continent's most politically stable.\u00a0We will be accompanied at all times by an accomplished Tanzanian naturalist\/guide who will be able to identify and tell us all about the wildlife encountered. We will listen for the sounds of the bush as we enjoy our comfortable camps and lodges. In settings of incomparable beauty and grandeur, we will savor the African dawn and sunset.At the end of our safari, we are in for a treat.\u00a0 We will fly over the Serengetti to Arusha, and then we fly to Zanzibar!\u00a0Off Tanzania's coast is the exotic Zanzibar Archipelago, consisting of over 50 islands, most of which have a long history and a rich cultural mix. The best known island here is Zanzibar (or Unguja Island, as it is more properly known). Zanzibar is the ultimate Indian Ocean experience.Everyone has heard of this unique place with its fascinating historical Stone Town, magnificent beaches and reefs.\u00a0 We will have the opportunity to enjoy a variety of options there.\u00a0 We snorkel, enjoy the different beaches, go on a Spice Island tour, as well as enjoy a dhow ride into the sunset! This island will be a fun and relaxing way to conclude the exciting safari.\u00a0Zanzibar's main industry is spices. The islands are covered with small farms and the air is thick with the aroma of spices growing there -- it's an exotic atmosphere. The islands produce cloves, nutmeg, cinnamon, and black pepper. That is why the islands, together with Tanzania's Mafia Island, are sometimes called the Spice Islands (a term also associated with the Maluku Islands in Indonesia).The beaches on these islands are stunning. Most are powdery white sand, shaded by palm trees. Picture perfect! The sea is shallow and tropical, and the reefs are great for snorkeling.The heart of Zanzibar Town, Stone Town, is a labyrinth of narrow alleys complete with palaces, mosques, and tiny shops. We will come here and soak up the atmosphere!Zanzibar also has its share of exotic animals.\u00a0 It is the home of the endemic Zanzibar Red Colobus Monkey, the Zanzibar Servaline Genet, and the (possibly extinct) Zanzibar Leopard.At the conclusion of this side-excursion, we will take a flight to Dar es Salaam, where our trip ends and we will be in time to take the KLM (or other) flight back to your home. Or you may choose to extend your trip in Africa or somewhere along the way. \u00a0","highlights":"View wildlife of the Serengeti and Ngorongo Crater, Delight in the thrill and adventure of a classic safari, Enjoy Zanzibar beaches and tropical fish","includes":"  Comfortable accommodations in lodges and private luxury,   Meals, admissions, and park entrance fees,   Transportation, airport pick-up, and in-country flights","itinerary":"Day 1:\u00a0The outing begins in the city of Arusha with an early morning orientation. Later we visit the Arusha Cultural Center fine arts museum and the Shanga House arts center for persons with disabilities, and enjoy a casual lunch surrounded by a coffee plantation. In the afternoon we are transferred to the School of St. Jude to meet students and tour this outstanding charity school that is helping to break the poverty cycle for children. In the evening we learn about Tanzania history and culture from a community leader and enjoy a welcome dinner.\u00a0\u00a0Days 2-3:\u00a0After breakfast, we drive to Tarangire National Park, the \u201cBaobab Capital of the World,\u201d where we will be for two nights. During this time of the year, nearly three thousand elephants are returning to the park to join another 3,500 resident elephants that call Tarangire home year-round. Wildebeest, zebra, gazelles and antelopes are also migrating from the surrounding areas for only water source within 1,600 square miles of protected wildlife area. Birds are equally abundant, with over 550 recorded species--EXPANDFROMHERE--. It is truly a favorite place to be for wildlife...and therefore, for humans! \u00a0Day 4:\u00a0We depart after breakfast and do game drives in the morning. Lunch will be a real treat. It will be served at a farm that grows its own vegetables. We will be able to tour the grounds, too. And anyone interested in coffee to take home will be able to purchase the local coffee from this farm. After our lunch, we stop at an Iraqw Village to understand their way of life and daily activities. We are in a hotel for one night here.Days 5-6:\u00a0We will depart with box lunches and enjoy a game drive on the way to the famous Ngorongoro Crater.\u00a0The Ngorongoro crater is home to over 30,000 animals including elephants, lions, cheetahs, wildebeests, buffaloes, and the rare black rhinos. It is in the Ngorongoro Conservation Area and is a UNESCO World Heritage site.\u00a0Ngorongoro Crater was created from a volcano that exploded creating the caldera wilderness haven. The crater is 12 miles across and has 102 square mile of wilderness. The rim of the crater rises just over 2,000 feet above the caldera floor reaching an elevation of 7,500 feet.\u00a0It is the largest un-flooded and unbroken caldera in the world and the view is a breathtaking. \u00a0We will spend the whole day there observing the wildlife in this wilderness haven!\u00a0We will stop at the Olduvai Gorge Archaeological Museum and gorge overlook which is the site of Louis and Mary Leakey\u2019s archaeological work. It was here that Mary Leakey discovered the earliest known humanoid footprints, which were solidified in volcanic ash some 3.6 million years ago.\u00a0 Standing at the top of the Gorge envisioning early ancestors evokes a feeling of returning home to the birthplace of humankind, quietly reminding us that we are all related. \u00a0We stay for two nights at a lodge on the rim of the crater.Day 7:\u00a0This morning we drive to the central Serengeti. The word \u201cSerengeti\u201d means \u201cEndless plains.\" Here, we are in search of the many \u201ccats\u201d that reside here. The leopards, cheetahs and lions to name a few. We also see the various antelope species and other species as well. We will arrive at our luxury camp (running water, electricity, flush toilets) for an evening of dinner under the stars (weather permitting) and turn in for a restful night among beautifully decorated and furnished surroundings. \u00a0We spend two nights at this lovely site.Day 8:\u00a0We will wake to the call of birds, or perhaps the howl of monkeys, or the roar of a lion. The fresh air and sounds of the wild will be all around you.\u00a0 This is where the heart of the activity will be.\u00a0 Some we may choose to spend the full day photographing and observing far away from the camp, or we may have better viewing opportunities to leave before sunrise and return for brunch and rest (while the animals typically also rest in the heat of the day). Late-afternoon drives allow us to enjoy the interesting light and increased activity of the predators. After these excursions, you will be met back at camp with cold beverages, appetizers, hot showers, a gourmet meal, and a crackling campfire.Day 9: We depart our luxury camp, and are in for a treat. First, we fly from the Central Serengeti to Arusha. Many times you are able to see herds of animals on the plains below. Once in Arusha, we will take an afternoon flight (both flights are included in the price of the trip) to Zanzibar. The flight leaves Arusha at 1:00 and arrives in Zanzibar at 2:35. We should get a glimpse of some beautiful scenery below, as well as Zanzibar Island as we approach it. We arrive there in the mid-afternoon. After arriving at our rustic hotel and getting settled in, we will enjoy a dhow cruise to enjoy the beautiful sunset in the Indian Ocean. We will return to Mangrove Lodge for dinner and overnight and get to know our hosts, Haji and his wife Marina and two young boys.Day 10: Today we depart from the lodge early and transfer to Nungwi to board a private dhow for snorkeling at the Mnemba Reef. We will get to see the marine life there while enjoying the warm waters. During lunch back at our hotel, we'll learn more about the history of Zanzibar. After that, we will enjoy a village tour and tour a local spice farm. We will relax and enjoy a beach BBQ dinner tonight, and if we are lucky, we will enjoy some music from the local music school.\u00a0Day 11: Today our day will be complete with a tour of Stone Town and the Slave Caves in the cooler morning. After lunch at a local restaurant, we will visit the Jozani forest, which includes mahogany woods, the unique Zanzibar Red Colobus Monkey, and mangroves. And a trip to the butterfly center will be a great addition. We then depart for the airport for our flight into Dar (included in the price of the trip). The flight typically leaves Zanzibar around 6:30 p.m. and arrives at the international terminal around 7:00 p.m. We will arrive in plenty of time to catch the KLM (or other airline) flight back to the US. We will have a simple dinner at the Dar airport. Unfortunately, this dream trip will come to an end. It will be sad to say goodbye to Africa, all the wonderful animals, and our new friends. You will be enticed to return again -- and soon!Occasionally, changes may occur in the trip -- either in advance or during the trip. Please be aware that we will make every effort to follow this itinerary.\u00a0However, if weather, equipment, construction, National Park Services or any other condition, circumstance or situation causes a change, please be flexible and respect the decision of the leader.

In the early morning hours, we board a large van that will take us to the start of our wilderness adventure. The Dalton Highway extends between Fairbanks and Prudhoe Bay and closely parallels the Alaska Oil Pipeline. During our long drive north toward the Brooks Range on the infamous \"haul road\" we will experience the beauty of the Alaskan interior. Making our way past the tree line and across the Arctic Circle, we climb over the Brooks Range and onto the North Slope.

That would be the Yampa River, and it is at its wildest in May and June when it swells with runoff from the high mountain snowpack. The Yampa flows out of the mountains of north-central Colorado and into the canyon country of Dinosaur National Monument, through 2,000-foot-high golden cliffs and wooded canyons carved by rain, snow, frost, and wind. From our launch at Deerlodge Park to its confluence with the Green River at Echo Park, the Yampa roars 46 miles through exciting rapids and a colorful canyon maze cutting deep into the Blue Mountain plateau. It then meets the Green River and we continue 31 miles through more canyons to the departure point. The Yampa\u2019s natural stream flow pattern and protected canyons are home to some of the last remaining healthy populations of river fishes and other rare wildlife. Above the river, desert bighorn sheep dance high on the cliffs, while eagles ride the currents in soft, circular patterns and peregrine falcons make dives for prey at blistering speed. There are miles of sheer, white and black tiger-striped walls, side-canyon waterfalls and 800-year-old Indian rock art--EXPANDFROMHERE--.Because it maintains much of its historic free-flowing stream pattern, the Yampa offers the thrill of running a truly wild river. Our rafts will plunge through many Class III-plus rapids, including Teepee and Big Joe. But the biggest challenge comes from a rapid that was born in 1965. One early evening that June, a huge flash flood carried tons of rock, mud, and boulders down Warm Springs Draw to the river, blocking the narrow river channel. Within 24 hours the Yampa took aim and breached the natural dam, leaving in its wake the Warm Springs Rapid, now rated as one of the \"10 Big Drops\" in the West. Hold on tight: Warm Springs during high runoff can be a Class IV rapid!At Echo Park, the Yampa joins the Green River, flowing south out of the Gates of Lodore. \"The Green is greatly increased by the Yampa,\" wrote Major John Wesley Powell in 1869. \"All this volume is set eddying and spinning in whirlpools, and the waters waltz through the canyon.\" We will make a lengthy stop at Jones Hole to explore its clear trout stream, waterfalls, and spectacular Fremont Indian rock art. On our last day, we'll run the truly remarkable Split Mountain Gorge, where the river has cut through the mountain instead of going around it. We will try to solve the puzzle that has troubled geologists for years: How did the river run directly into, rather than around, this mountain range? At this point, the canyon walls close in, and the river picks up speed. This is one of the Green's steepest stretches, with the river dropping 20 feet per mile. These last 10 miles will make for an exciting, raucous, and spectacular end to a fabulous trip!Sturdy 18-foot, oar-powered rafts will accompany our trip, each guided by an experienced, licensed river guide. Also, several inflatable kayaks will be \u201cshared\u201d among participants, which, with minimal instruction, will allow you to play in the river on your own, except in the largest rapids. If you wish to participate by paddling, an all-paddle boat can be added if a sufficient number of trip members wish to do so.

After a tour of this totally over-the-top dream home, we\u2019ll head up the short path to the Marienbr\u00fccke (Mary's Bridge), which spans the ravine above Neuschwanstein for an unforgettable castle view. Leaving the crowds behind and continuing our hike, we\u2019ll walk for about three miles, gaining 2,300 feet to arrive at the Tegelberg viewpoint, where we\u2019ll stop for refreshment at this mountain restaurant. Weather permitting, we\u2019ll see hang gliders and paragliders launch from this mountaintop site, before we ride the cable gondola down to Hohenschwangau and take the bus back to our hotel. Overnight: F\u00fcssen.Day 10:\u00a0After breakfast, we\u2019ll take a short bus ride back across the border to Reutte, Austria where we\u2019ll hike up to the lonely ruins of 13th\u00a0CE Ehrenberg Castle, an interesting contrast to the much-visited Neuschwanstein. After our castle walk, we\u2019ll head back towards F\u00fcssen, stopping for lunch at a lakeside inn. Our free afternoon in F\u00fcssen offers an opportunity for some shopping in the pedestrian-only town center, a walk up to the Hohes Schloss (High Castle), or perhaps just time to relax. Overnight:\u00a0F\u00fcssen.Day 11:\u00a0We'll board our bus for the two-hour trip to Munich, leave our bags at the hotel, and then begin a guided bus and walking tour of the city. \u00a0After viewing the famous mechanical carillon in Marienplatz square, we\u2019ll walk over to the nearby Viktualienmarkt (a bustling outdoor food market).

To reach this remote place, you\u2019ll need to travel along glacier-carved Lake Chelan -- a 55-mile-long, 1,450-foot-deep inland fjord. Lake Chelan, meaning \u201cdeep water,\u201d is the largest natural lake in Washington State and the second deepest in the country. (From ridgetop to lake bottom, it is the deepest gorge in the U.S.) \u00a0The mountainous region surrounding the Stehekin Valley and the north end of Lake Chelan is so outstanding that it merits three wilderness areas, two national recreation areas, and a national park.The valley is accessible only by foot, boat, or floatplane, which keeps it both peaceful and barely developed. From the small village of Stehekin, at the upper end of Lake Chelan, a partly paved and partly gravel road runs into the heart of the North Cascades, providing access to many hiking trails. The road was built to support limited early mining activity and doesn\u2019t connect to any other road. As a result, the only vehicles you\u2019ll see here belong to the Park Service and the valley\u2019s few permanent residents.A mid-week unstructured day affords participants an opportunity to take advantage of other recreational activities in the area, which include horseback riding, kayaking, fishing, and bike riding. The cost of these is not included in the trip price. The little village of Stehekin boasts espresso and homemade pastries, hiking maps, books, and a post office, as well as historic buildings that we can visit.In the evenings, we will gather at the main lodge, where our meals will be served.

Our hikes can include trips to 320-foot Rainbow Falls, the impressive chasm of Agnes Gorge, or the Lakeshore Trail along Lake Chelan.\u00a0Each day hike has a similar pattern of elevation gain.

A merchant sailor, Baranov used the bay as a refuge during a dangerous storm in the late 1700s. The storm ended on Easter Sunday and so the bay was renamed Resurrection Bay. Seward, the main settlement in the bay, was founded in 1903 as the terminus of the Alaska Railway. It is one of the oldest communities in Alaska and is one of the only ice-free ports in Alaska with various ways of transportation into the interior--EXPANDFROMHERE--.Because of the strategic location of Caines Head, Fort McGilvray was built there during WWII (1941) to defend against a possible invasion by the Imperial Japanese Army.

Alaska Railroad, the site rapidly grew in size and importance. \u00a0Anchorage is now a cosmopolitan city with wonderful restaurants, breweries, markets, shops, museums, theaters, and schools, albeit with somewhat of a frontier atmosphere.Within 60 miles of Anchorage are two interesting areas we will visit: \u00a0a chain of lakes that is popular for kayaking, and a mountain pass providing easy access to lovely alpine vistas and a glimpse of the area\u2019s mining past. \u00a0We continue on to visit two iconic parks: \u00a0Denali State Park and Denali National Park. \u00a0The state park is popular, but less crowded, and we are free to engage in more activities there, such as kayaking and hiking. \u00a0In the national park our focus will be to experience the unsurpassable Denali bus tour deep into the park.Our trip then takes us to the historic village of Talkeetna, whose roots lay in the gold mining boom of the turn of the 20th century. \u00a0Situated at the foot of North America\u2019s tallest peak, Denali, it is also a hub of climbing activity and history. \u00a0Add to it the flavor of an outdoorsy and artistic population, and you have a great stop.Lastly, after a night back in Anchorage, we travel about 60 miles to the southeast to the town of Whittier, accessible by boat, plane, or the 2.5-mile-long Anton Anderson Memorial Tunnel, the longest highway tunnel

Accompanied by a naturalist we go ashore to experience the variety of beaches, wetlands, and forests up close, or kayak (no experience necessary) along the sculpted coastlines. Often we enjoy both activities every day!\u00a0 While searching out the tracks and trails of wildlife, we can absorb the diversity of plant life in the microenvironments of the bay.The voices of Glacier Bay are a joy to experience! In addition to the thunderous sounds made as ice shifts and enormous icebergs break and calve from the face of tidewater glaciers, we will hear the calls of raucous gulls and terns, the bark of sea lions, the feeding and \u201cpec slapping\u201d of humpback whales. If we are very lucky, we may hear the eerie howl of a wolf.Glaciers, mountains, rivers, forests, tundra: a landscape rich with places that have never felt the tread of human feet. It thrills me not because I can break first ground, but because first ground remains unbroken.\u00a0 \u00a0The Only Kayak: A Journey into the Heart of Alaska by Kim HeacoxThe 3.3 million acres of Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve are part of a larger 25-million acre international Biosphere Reserve and UNESCO World Heritage Site, made up of Kluane \/ Wrangell-St. Elias \/ Glacier Bay \/ Tatshenshini-Alsek. Together these parks form the world\u2019s largest non-polar ice field. Comprised of wild coastlines, temperate rainforests, sheltered fjords, tidewater glaciers, and snow-capped peaks, and ranging from the outer coast to the summit of 15,325-foot Mt. Fairweather, Glacier Bay is a land of contrasts.\u00a0Just over 200 years ago, when Captain George Vancouver charted the waters of Icy Strait, what we now call Glacier Bay was a five-mile indentation in a gigantic glacier that stretched to the horizon. At that time the glacier was more than 4,000 feet thick, up to 20 miles wide, and extended inland more than 100 miles. In 1879, when naturalist John Muir first explored Glacier Bay, he discovered that the ice had retreated more than 30 miles. By 1916, The Grand Pacific Glacier, the main glacier credited with carving the bay, had melted back 60 miles to what is now Tarr Inlet.\u2026 a bay in Alaska, near Juneau, a bay reborn from the icy tomb of a great glacier that buried it just two hundred years ago. When the ice retreated it unveiled a new home for wolves and whales, a world in transition from bare rock to bears, a magical place, a miracle place\u2026 \u00a0if you believe in miracles.\u00a0The Only Kayak: A Journey into the Heart of Alaska\u00a0by Kim HeacoxSince Glacier Bay has so recently emerged from the ice, it is considered a geologically young area, and trip up Glacier Bay is like a trip back in time. Old growth forests give way to bare rock as we make our way into the upper reaches of the bay where glaciers continue their slow retreat. Along the way, our expert naturalist and guide will point out the finer points of biological succession, glaciation, local geology, and the interconnectedness of the animals that call this area home.For countless generations the Huna Tlingit people lived and prospered in the shadows of the glaciers near what is now the park headquarters at Bartlett Cove. During the 1700s advancing glaciers of the Little Ice Age forced the Huna people to relocate to nearby villages. On August 25, 2016, the new Huna Tribal House adjacent to park headquarters was dedicated. The tribal house was originally conceived to be a place for tribal members to reconnect with their ancestral homeland, but has proven to be much more. It also serves as a venue for the Huna Tlingit to share their culture and history with park visitors. We will have a chance to see this special place. As we tour Glacier Bay we will gain an understanding of the bounty of resources the bay has provided for the Huna people and how it has become woven into the tapestry of their lives.Our voyage begins in picturesque Gustavus, Alaska. Traditionally a logging town, Gustavus (population 400) has evolved into a town that serves visitors to Glacier Bay National Park and has a reputation of having more moose than residents! Our group will rendezvous at a cozy lodge in Gustavus where we will get acquainted, enjoy a short walk and share our first meal. The next morning, after a tour of park headquarters at Bartlett Cove, we will board our boat to tour the bay for the week. The days will be full, for at this time of year we will experience \u201cthe midnight sun,\u201d although it will be nearly dark between 11:30 p.m. and 2:30 a.m. \u00a0At the close of each day the boat will anchor in a protected cove where we can reflect on our adventures, share a meal, and turn in for the night.\u00a0 The daily itinerary will be flexible to account for weather conditions, tides, group interests, and animal sightings. Please consider the following itinerary as a sample only.\"To the lover of pure wildness Alaska is one of the most wonderful countries in the world.\" \u2013 John Muir","highlights":"Observe whales, sea otters, puffins, and bald eagles, Hike, kayak, and explore in the Glacier Bay fjords, Witness calving glaciers","includes":"  All meals, lodging and gratuities at lodge and on yacht,   Interpretive naturalist\/marine biologist ,   Use of sea kayaks,   ","itinerary":"Potential Itinerary Day 1: Our trip begins with an orientation meeting at a lodge in Gustavus, followed by a short get-acquainted walk along one of the local trails. The day concludes back at the lodge with an inviting dinner.Day 2: After breakfast, our main adventure begins!\u00a0 At 8:15 a.m. we depart for Bartlett Cove, located at Glacier Bay National Park Headquarters (about a 15 minute drive). We will explore Bartlett Cove for a few hours. During this time we will have the opportunity to view \u201cSnow,\u201d the skeletal remains of a humpback whale that was killed by a cruise ship in 2001 and reconstructed in 2014. As time permits, we walk the spruce\/hemlock rainforest nature trail, and tour the new Huna Tribal House--EXPANDFROMHERE--. At 11 a.m. we board our new home (a 65-foot motor vessel), assign cabins, have a safety talk, enjoy lunch, and then get underway to start our voyage exploring Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve.Days 3-8:\u00a0We will cruise, kayak, and hike this gem of a national park. Wildlife sightings, weather, and the desires of the group will influence the daily itinerary, and the schedule of each day will be open in order to take advantage of opportunities to see wildlife and glaciers. Bears walk the shores, bald eagles soar above, and mountain goats traverse the cliff walls. Moose tend to be shy at this time of year, as they are with calves, but their tracks can be seen as we walk the shorelines. Along the way we may find sea otters floating by us, porpoises swimming alongside the yacht, and seals lounging atop icebergs. The greatest treats will be if we encounter a breaching humpback whale, observe a pod of orca gliding past, or catch a glimpse of an elusive wolf walking the shore. Our small vessel allows us access to shoreline areas that are inaccessible to larger ships, which enables us to make frequent stops each day to view wildlife, kayak the inlets and bays, and hike along the shores of this magical place.\u00a0Our travels will take us up both the East (Muir Inlet) and West Arms of Glacier Bay, exploring inlets, islands, and glaciers while watching for wildlife. We will observe how succession acts to replace glacial clay and till with the lush foliage of the temperate rainforest. At times, while motoring from one location to another, our naturalist will share short presentations on glaciers or the animals we see, as well as knowledge of the Huna Tlingit people. Our vessel maintains a library consisting of both reference material and Alaska adventure reading. We will refer to the library to gain greater insight on animals, plants, and geology as questions arise. Participants are welcome to borrow from the collection for reading.\u00a0Evenings will bring secluded anchorages with time to reflect and share a delicious meal prepared by our chef in the galley. As Alaska is also known as the Land of the Midnight Sun, we can take advantage of the long days (it is semi-dark from about 11:30 p.m. to 2:30 a.m.). Many evenings will offer time to quietly explore the shores by walking, kayaking, or slow motoring along in the skiff. It\u2019s amazing how much can be seen and heard along the shores during the quiet evening time. Before turning in for the night, we will bring out the charts to review the day and make a plan for the following day. We keep the schedule flexible to accommodate the multitude of variables that can be encountered along the way.Toward the end of the trip, we will venture outside the bay and across Icy Strait to explore the outer coast. Here we will encounter a completely different landscape of windswept islands, rugged sea cliffs, and whirling sea birds. As time and weather permit, we to hope to stop off at the small town of Elfin Cove, which is made up of a boardwalk, small stores, and boat slips, as well as visit George Island for a short hike to view a big gun installation left from World War II.Day 9: The last day of our trip will bring us back to Bartlett Cove, where we will arrive between 11 a.m. and noon, with a newfound appreciation of the world in which we lived, as well as memories (and photos) to last a lifetime. As needed, your Sierra Club leader will assist you with getting your luggage situated and locating your transportation to the airport, ferry, or lodging. Glacier Bay Lodge at Bartlett Cove has a restaurant where you can enjoy a no-host lunch. You can also spend additional time hiking the Forest Loop, learning about the Huna Tribal House, watching one of the Park Service movies, or viewing the exhibits we may not have had enough time for at the start of our cruise.\u00a0Following the trip, you may opt to continue on with additional Alaska adventures, exploring other areas of this beautiful state. Or you may wish to stay extra nights in either Bartlett Cove (at the Glacier Bay Lodge) or in Gustavus to further experience a small coastal Alaska town.Occasionally, changes may occur in the trip\u2014either in advance of or during the trip. Please be aware we will make every attempt to stay within this suggested itinerary. However, if weather, equipment, or any other condition causes a change, please be flexible and respect the decision of the leader. The safety of the group is our primary concern. Also, while wildlife in Alaska\u2019s Glacier Bay is tremendous, we cannot guarantee you will see all species listed here as examples.\u00a0","leader1":"Margie Tomenko","leader2":"","leader3":""}},{"trip":{"title":"Canoe the Allagash River Wilderness Waterway, Maine","id":"18196A","dates":"Jul 1, 2018 to Jul 8, 2018","destination":"United States, Maine","type":"Canoe","group":"","difficulty":"","priceHigh":"1175","priceLow":"1175","image":{"src":"https:\/\/content.sierraclub.org\/outings\/sites\/content.sierraclub.org.outings\/files\/styles\/trip-teaser\/public\/trips\/main-images\/18196_main_SteveDay.jpg?itok=-pofMOXM","alt":"Canoe the Allagash River Wilderness Waterway, Maine"},"path":"\/outings\/canoe-river-wilderness-maine#trip=18196A","overview":"The Trip\u201cI\u2019m sure there are many things I\u2019ll never learn from traveling over the earth by canoe.\u00a0 I\u2019m just not sure any of them are worth much.\u201d -\u00a0Douglas Woods,\u00a0\"Paddle Whispers\"This is an epic paddling journey, a classic, Maine\u2019s legendary Allagash River Wilderness Waterway, a 100-mile-long chain of lakes and rivers, and one of the few eastern rivers that can be paddled a week or longer without coming into contact with modern civilization.The Allagash has attracted paddlers for more than a century, and was designated a National Wild and Scenic River in 1970. From tranquil lakes (less tranquil when the wind kicks up in the afternoon) to easy-flowing flatwater river sections to some quick water and moderate Class II whitewater paddling (options to portage these sections), the Allagash has it all. The Allagash is also one of your best bets to see moose and bald eagles and to drift off to sleep to the cry of the loon echoing across the lake. The upper end of Umsaskis Lake on day four of our trip, in particular, is like a wildlife park, a prime moose feeding area, with otter, mink, muskrat, beaver, ducks, geese, and birds of prey as well.\u201cPrimeval, untamed, and forever untamable nature\u201d is how Henry David Thoreau describes the Maine woods after his explorations in 1846.

We will make sure everyone has the necessary and appropriate gear for our trip.Day 2: Today we go by van to our put-in at Indian Stream, and load and then line our canoes for the first ~1\/2 hour walking in water up to our ankles before we start our paddle across Eagle Lake. We stop most likely at Farm Island for the night. Along the way, time permitting, we may stop at The Tramway, a small town where workers built a miniature cable railroad, or tramway, around 1903 to carry logs 3\/4 mile from Eagle Lake to Chamberlain Lake to be driven by water down to the Penobscot River. At peak production, a half-million board feet of logs were handled in a single day. In the 1920s, a full-size railroad took over transporting logs. The two oil-fired locomotives still sit where they were abandoned more then seven decades ago.Day 3: We continue our paddle up Eagle Lake (total 12 miles on Eagle Lake), a 2-mile run through the thoroughfare. We continue 5 more miles across Churchill Lake, camping at The Jaws, just before Churchill Dam.\u00a0Day 4: Our gear and those of us wishing to go with the gear are transported around the dam and the first 4.5 miles of Class II Whitewater through Chase Rapids. Those who wish will paddle with the water release at 9:00 a.m. We then meet back up with the gear and the group to paddle the remaining 4.5 miles of Class I water and then 5 miles across Umsaskis Lake, where we camp most likely at The Ledges or Sandy Point. Weather, group, and conditions dependent, we might continue on down through the thoroughfare and another 5 miles through Long Lake to camp at Long Lake Dam, where we portage our canoes.Days 5-7: We continue paddling the 10-mile run downriver to Round Pond, possibly camping at Round Pond Rips.

It is also the longest river located entirely within a single state. Boaters who travel the river downstream pass through the largest designated wilderness in the Lower 48\u2014the Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness. Three times larger than the state of Rhode Island, this inspiring and intimidating landscape thwarted some of the West's early white explorers. After noting the canyon's deep gorge, steep walls, and swift rapids, Captain Clark of the Lewis and Clark Expedition decided a long northern detour was preferable to a descent of the Main Salmon. Later, pioneers managed to float some sections of the river, but paddling back upstream proved futile; hence, the river gained its nickname--EXPANDFROMHERE--.The legendary \"River of No Return\" draws boaters from all over the world with its remarkable combination of solitude, wildlife, whitewater, and scenery. We will travel 81 miles of the Main Salmon, from the Corn Creek put-in (near the town of Salmon) to our take-out at Carey Creek (near Riggins). Among the many Class III rapids we will encounter along the way are Devil's Teeth, Salmon Falls, Big Mallard (know as one of the West\u2019s 10 big drops), Elkhorn, and Chittam.\"It has been remarked that history is the bed carved by the river of life. That being true, few western canyons can claim a river-bed so deeply incised as that of the Salmon\u2026\" - Carrey & Conley, 1978Salmon River country is a land of superlatives. The river's canyon is one of the deepest in North America; it is 6,000 feet from the river to the tallest bordering peaks. Originating as a rivulet in the southern Sawtooth Valley, the Salmon River quickly becomes big water and one of the major rivers of the intermountain West. Draining 14,000 square miles, this wild river is fed by snow from the Sawtooth, Clearwater, Bitterroot, and Salmon River mountains.With no upstream dams to block the movement of sediment, the Main Salmon renews its superb beaches each year and provides us with delightful campsites. As we enjoy our journey downstream, the scenery will change from rugged pine-forested mountains to black granite gorges, and then to the arid open slopes of the high desert. The river allows us scenic and exhilarating access into the heart of wild Idaho.While we explore the river, we'll discover its rich history, beginning with the prehistoric ancestors of the Nez Perce and Northern Shoshoni who lived there nearly 8,500 years ago and continuing through the years to include trappers, prospectors, ranchers, dam-builders, wilderness advocates, whitewater boaters, and many others.Our put-in date and six-day trip length will allow us a warmer, more relaxed time on the river. This trip has been designed to allow plenty of time to revel in the myriad delights of the river corridor: more than 40 rapids, natural hot springs, cascading side streams, Native American pictographs, old mining claims, historic pioneer cabins, and abundant wildlife. Bighorn sheep, black bear, mountain goats, salmon, steelhead, bald and golden eagles, wolves (they've returned!)\u2014the list of magnificent creatures inhabiting this land is lengthy.The pace of the trip will be leisurely.

Recently the sea ice has frozen later and melted earlier, which has exposed the coastline to erosion from waves. \u00a0Not only have an estimated 75% of the artifacts from this site already been washed away, but so have the sites of previous years\u2019 digs. \u00a0Our help in rescuing remaining items will be greatly appreciated--EXPANDFROMHERE--.This trip takes us to the small coastal village of Quinhagak (also spelled Kwinhagak). \u00a0It is a community of about 700 people, primarily Yup\u2019ik. \u00a0The town is situated on the Kanektok River, which is noted as a prime watercourse for excellent fishing. \u00a0Bring your pole and an Alaska fishing license!

Our hotel is the historic Kvikne's Hotel, which dates back to 1877.Balestrand lies between towering, snow-covered mountains and the majestic Sognefjord in a beautiful and lush fjord landscape. The impressive scenery and the constantly changing light brought many painters here to capture the fascinating play of light on canvas. This afternoon we will have a short orientation to Kvikne's Hotel and Balestrand, eat a simple lunch at one of the quaint fjord-side restaurants, and take a short, warm-up hike in the forested area above Balestrand.Dinner tonight is Kvikne's famous sm\u00f8rg\u00e5sbord -- a huge selection of Norwegian specialties, including salads and hot and cold entrees, featuring meats, fish, cheeses, vegetables, and more, and fabulous desserts.Day 3:\u00a0Balestrand: Cider House Farm.\u2028 After your sm\u00f8rg\u00e5sbord breakfast, we have a brief introduction to the history of Balestrand and then walk to the Sogn Fruit Farm and Cider House. The Cider House includes an orchard with many apple varieties and beautiful views. We will have a personal presentation of their farm and cider production, followed by lunch. You have many choices for our afternoon, which include exploring Balestrand on your own, hiking with your leaders, or perusing quaint shops. At the local grocery store, each of us will get supplies for tomorrow\u2019s lunch. Dinner and overnight at Kvikne's Hotel.Day 4:\u00a0Balestrand to Luster.\u2028 After a leisurely breakfast, we will depart about 9:30 a.m. by private mini-bus for Leikanger and our lodgings at Nes G\u00e5rd, a bed-and-breakfast guesthouse. Before arriving at Nes G\u00e5rd, we hike up Molden Mountain, located on a peninsula, which affords a panoramic view of Lusterfjord. The hike leads up through a forested area then through an area of broad stones. At the summit, we relax, have our lunch, and enjoy the views before returning by the same route to our awaiting bus for the short drive on to Nes G\u00e5rd. Molden Mountain's summit is at 3,670 feet. The hike ascends 1,700 feet.Norway's longest and deepest fjord, the Sognefjord, lies in the heart of Fjord Norway and extends more than 200 miles inland. The Lusterfjord is an arm of the Sognefjord, surrounded by the glaciers and high mountains of the Jotunheimen and Jostedalsbreen national parks. Along both shores of the fjord are villages and lush landscapes where fruits and berries grow on small, idyllic farms.Nes G\u00e5rd overlooks the Lusterfjord, with newly renovated rooms in the traditional farmhouse dating to the 1850s and adjacent buildings. We'll enjoy four day-hikes on good trails through a magnificent green landscape, with thundering waterfalls, lonely homesteads, and summer farms up in the mountains. Please note that the following proposed daily hiking itinerary is subject to adjustment, depending on safety considerations at the time, including weather, trail conditions, and other factors. Dinner and overnight at Nes G\u00e5rd.Day 5:\u00a0Hike Vigdal - Navarsete (five hours).\u2028 Today\u2019s hike passes the mountain farm Vigdalst\u00f8l and Fivlenosi, 4,000 feet above sea level, with a view of the Jostedal Glacier, which is the largest glacier in continental Europe. Our hike continues down through the green valley of Engedalen. We\u2019ll have ascended 1,700 feet and descended 1,800 by the end of the day. Dinner and overnight at Nes G\u00e5rd.Day 6:\u00a0Hike Morkridsdalen Valley.\u2028 We drive to the upper end of Lusterfjord and into Breheimen National Park. Hiking up the Morkridsdalen Valley, we enjoy close-up views of a glacial river and then walk past a lovely lake. After a steep but short climb, our path goes through a park-like landscape until we reach the summer farm buildings and pastures at Dulsete, where we enjoy our lunch. We then continue up the valley to view several waterfalls before hiking down for our return to Nes G\u00e5rd. This hike is tremendously varied in terrain, vegetation, and viewpoints.\u00a0 Estimated distance is six to eight miles with 500-800 feet of elevation gain. Dinner and overnight at Nes G\u00e5rd.Day 7:\u00a0Jostedalsbreen National Park: Jostedal Glacier - Valley of Krundalen.\u2028 Almost half of the Jostedalsbreen National Park is covered by the Jostedal Glacier. Today we'll experience the glacier up close. First, we follow a river on a relatively flat trail for an hour and a half up the Krundalen Valley to a viewpoint that overlooks the hanging Bergset glacier (Bergsetbreen), one of several arms of the Jostedalbreem. The glacier arm drops sheer down the mountain face, an imposing sight. Afterward, we will visit Nigardsbreen (Nigards Glacier), one of the more impressive of Jostedal Glacier's 22 arms.\u00a0 We'll travel by boat across the lake, where we can walk right up to the glacier. We\u2019ll have lunch at the glacier's terminal moraine as we admire the blue-ice glacier a short distance from where we sit. Afterward, if time permits, we will take an afternoon walk in a nearby valley or visit the Breheimen Glacier Museum. Return to Nes G\u00e5rd for dinner and overnight.Day 8:\u00a0Explore the Lusterfjord, including Urnes Stave Church.\u2028 Today we set off for a full day of cultural and sightseeing activities around the scenic Lusterfjord. We first visit the idyllic village of Solvorn not far from Nes G\u00e5rd. From Solvorn we take a small ferry across the Lusterfjord to visit the Urnes Stave Church, built around 1150. Norway's oldest stave church,\u00a0Urnes Stave Church\u00a0is featured on the UNESCO World Heritage List. (Stave churches are an early type of heavy timber construction.)\u00a0 After lunch, we hike to a scenic viewpoint overlooking the Lusterfjord (about four miles and 1,000 feet of elevation gain), complete our full-circle drive around the Lusterfjord, and return to Nes G\u00e5rd for dinner and overnight.Day 9:\u00a0Luster to Oslo.\u2028 Today, we transfer by private van to Fl\u00e5m, about an hour away. We then depart on the Fl\u00e5m Railway (Fl\u00e5msbana). Widely regarded as one of the most exciting train trips in Europe, it is one of the world's steepest standard-gauge railways, with a gradient of 5.5% as we ascend to the village of Myrdal. From Myrdal we continue on the Bergen Railway (Northern Europe's highest altitude rail line), traveling across the mountains -- the \"Roof of Norway\" -- and arrive in Oslo in early evening. We transfer to our Oslo hotel for the next two nights.Day 10:\u00a0Oslo City Tour. \u2028After our sm\u00f8rg\u00e5sbord breakfast, we will enjoy a full day of activities in Oslo, Norway\u2019s capital city. Our local guide will present information on Norway's history, culture, and social system. We\u2019ll use a variety of local public transportation options (tram, bus and ferry) to visit selected sites. During our exploration in Oslo, our guide will point out important buildings, including Parliament, the King\u2019s Palace, and the National Theater. We will visit City Hall (site of the annual Nobel Peace Prize ceremony) and the Vigeland Sculpture Park (also called Frogner Park), which features works in bronze and granite by sculptor Gustav Vigeland. After a casual lunch, we\u2019ll visit the Viking Ship Museum, which houses two restored Viking ships and some of the treasures that had been buried with them. There are many options for the remainder of the afternoon, including the Norwegian Folk Museum, the Thor Heyerdahl Kon-Tiki Museum, the Nobel Peace Center, the National Gallery, and the Norwegian Resistance Museum. This evening we will meet for our farewell dinner and share thoughts and recollections about our trip.Day 11:\u00a0Depart from Oslo. \u2028After breakfast, you can take a convenient bus to the Oslo airport -- or extend your stay in Norway!","leader1":"Hurston Roberts","leader2":"Aurora Roberts","leader3":""}},{"trip":{"title":"Volcanic Vacation: Hut-to-Hut Trekking in Iceland","id":"18760A","dates":"Jul 10, 2018 to Jul 21, 2018","destination":"Europe, Iceland","type":"International","group":"","difficulty":"","priceHigh":"5895","priceLow":"5895","image":{"src":"https:\/\/content.sierraclub.org\/outings\/sites\/content.sierraclub.org.outings\/files\/styles\/trip-teaser\/public\/trips\/main-images\/17780_1_MichaelJensen.jpg?itok=3_NE1YgQ","alt":""},"path":"\/outings\/volcanic-vacation-hut-trekking-iceland#trip=18760A","overview":"The TripThis customized epic adventure offers a pure landscape and beautiful contrast of scenery that resembles the kind of journey that only Tolkien could dream up! \u00a0Experience the classic trek in Iceland; Laugarvegur, with the added bonus of two days of trekking where few have gone before.

Halfway up, we can detour to the plateau of Morinshei\u00f0i to walk on top of the cliffs, which give us an astounding view of these ice caps and their surroundings. The slope becomes pretty steep and snowfields are more common. However, at the pass, before the Baldvinsskali hut, we will discover fields of dark lava and the reddish craters from the eruption of the Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull volcano in spring 2010. Close to the hut, if the weather is clear, we will have a view of the ocean as a reward.

Gould and Many Glacier Valley.Day 4:\u00a0By now you may recognize that a choice between two trail options is difficult in such a scenic Park.\u00a0And today is no easier.\u00a0In the Many Glacier area, prime habitat for bears, the trail to Grinnell Glacier is 11.5 miles round-trip, with a 1,500-foot elevation gain, and Ptarmigan Tunnel is 10.7 miles with a 2,300-foot gain.The first few miles on the trail to Grinnell Glacier roll gently through a forest and past two mountain lakes. As we begin our ascent, stair-stepping under a waterfall, we'll pass colorful rock strata with a view of a turquoise lake below. The higher we climb the more spectacular our view will become. You\u2019ll want to take time to look for bighorn sheep climbing on rocks or laying in a meadow. Our last push will be over a rocky moraine to Upper Grinnell Lake, a milky blue lake formed by the melting glacier. Up until now, we have been learning about climate change and its impact upon glaciers through our on-trail education. Now is our opportunity to see a glacier, stromatolites, and more as we explore this area.The Ptarmigan Tunnel trail ascends the Wilbur Creek Valley, with views of Mt. Grinnel, Swiftcurrent Mountain and Mt. Wilbur. After viewing Ptarmigan Falls, we\u2019ll begin a steeper ascent, passing an area that can be rich in huckleberries, a grizzly favorite.\u00a0 We\u2019ll eventually have a view of the Ptarmigan Wall, an ar\u00eate, rising 1,700 feet above the trail, and cascading falls as we approach colorful Ptarmigan Lake and the switchbacks leading to the tunnel above it.\u00a0 The last push to the historic tunnel, built in the 1930s by the Civilian Conservation Corps, is well worth the effort. There are spectacular views from both ends of the tunnel to include Old Sun Glacier, Belly River, and Elizabeth Lake.Day 5:\u00a0Kick back day has arrived!\u00a0One option, a half-day river float, is not included in the trip price. Last year\u2019s price was $60.00. On the first July trip, (July 14-21) there is a second option in addition to a float.\u00a0\u00a0We\u2019ll do an in\/out hike (approximately 4.5 miles total), along McDonald Creek to see McDonald Falls, Sacred Dancing Cascades, and ponds to look for female Harlequin ducks and moose. Afterward, we\u2019ll have lunch at the head of Lake McDonald and then visit the lodge. Both trips will include time to explore the shops at Apgar Village (and their tasty huckleberry ice cream), located at the southern end of Lake McDonald and not far from our field camp.Day 6:\u00a0Two Medicine Valley, located in the southeast corner of the Park, is today's destination. Considered by the tribes of the Blackfeet Nation to be a place of religious significance, this broad U-shaped valley was scoured by a long-ago glacier. Some of its rugged peaks are the most photographed in the park. The first trail option, Cobalt Lake, is 11.4 miles round-trip, with an elevation gain of 1,400 feet. The trail follows the south shore of Two Medicine Lake, eventually passing beaver ponds, which we\u2019ll be checking out for resident moose. Further along the trail, after having crossed a suspended bridge, we\u2019ll take a few minutes at Rockwell Falls for photo opportunities and looking for dippers (the Audubon, not people, type), before ascending a series of switchbacks with magnificent views to the blue-green Cobalt Lake.The second trail option, Two Medicine Lake Loop, is an approximate 9- to 10-mile hike with an elevation gain of 780 feet. Our trail will follow the north shore of Two Medicine Lake beneath Rising Wolf Mountain. As we pass by avalanche chutes, we\u2019ll have unobstructed views of Never Laughs, Sinopah, and other mountain peaks. As the trail curves at the head of the lake, we\u2019ll take a side trip to view Twin Falls.\u00a0 As we continue our loop, we\u2019ll have more views of a very scenic lake surrounded by massive peaks.\u00a0 We\u2019ll take a side trail to Aster Falls and Aster Park Overlook for a view of the Two Medicine Valley, and then complete our loop.Day 7:\u00a0On our final day, the first hike option is Numa Ridge Lookout. Numa is approximately 12 miles round trip with 2,930 feet of elevation gain in a less visited, wilder area of the park, the northwest corner. We begin our hike at colorful Bowman Lake, the third largest in the park, which offers quite a scenic backdrop. Passing through the forest, we\u2019ll begin our ascent up, looking for birds, bears, and other wildlife. The higher we climb, the more we\u2019ll notice the changing forest and wildflowers, and begin to see views of the lake. At the top is a fire lookout, built in 1933, with an incredible view of magnificent peaks and lakes in the distance.Firebrand Pass is 9.6 miles round-trip with a 2,200-foot elevation gain. This trail is located in the southern sector, one of the least traveled areas of the park. We\u2019ll begin our hike by crossing an open field into a forest of aspen and pine trees. As we ascend the trail through high vegetation with abundant wildflower color, we may break into song or chatter to avoid a surprise bear encounter. We\u2019ll continue our climb, leaving the tree line behind. Once at the top, we'll be afforded spectacular views of Glacier Park's southern peaks.\u00a0\u00a0Day 8:\u00a0The trip will end after breakfast. For those flying out of Glacier Park International Airport, Institute staff will provide transportation to the airport. Please don't schedule your flights to depart before noon.","leader1":"Sandra Kiplinger","leader2":"Stephen Brown","leader3":""}},{"trip":{"title":"50-Plus Ramble in Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado","id":"18227A","dates":"Jul 14, 2018 to Jul 21, 2018","destination":"United States, Colorado","type":"Lodge","group":"","difficulty":"","priceHigh":"1795","priceLow":"1795","image":{"src":"https:\/\/content.sierraclub.org\/outings\/sites\/content.sierraclub.org.outings\/files\/styles\/trip-teaser\/public\/trips\/main-images\/18227_main_DaveFerguson_0_0.jpg?itok=JX69j4cE","alt":"50-Plus Ramble in Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado"},"path":"\/outings\/50-plus-rocky-mountain-national-park-colorado#trip=18227A","overview":"The TripJoin other 50-plus-year-olds as we\u00a0ramble through Rocky Mountain National Park, allowing us to experience one of the most beautiful places in the world while creating new friendships with amazing people from across the country.

Today, with the continued reductions in funds for our parks and monuments, keeping the Grand Canyon\u2019s fragile environment as it should be can only be done with the additional help of volunteers like you.The ProjectOur mission is to assist the park\u2019s staff with various vegetation management efforts. We never know where we may be asked to work -- sometimes it is along a stream, a railroad track, or a breathtakingly scenic area at the edge of the Grand Canyon. We may assist with the critical tasks of clearing brush, stacking cut wood for future controlled burns, gathering seeds of native species or removing invasive species, and almost anything else that needs to be done. All of our projects are under the direction of the park's knowledgeable experts. Past trip participants who subsequently returned to the canyon report a tremendous feeling of satisfaction at seeing plants that they planted in years past flourishing in the sun, or at seeing a fence they constructed successfully rerouting park visitors away from a degraded area.","highlights":"Enjoy the North Rim's many activities, Help preserve and restore a national treasure, Enjoy a community of like-minded people","includes":"  Great meals,   Camping in a beautiful national park,   Tools and instruction from Park Service staff","itinerary":"The group will assemble at the North Rim\u2019s backcountry office at 1:00 p.m. on day one.

Challenge yourself on a variety of day hikes, returning to base camp each day to enjoy the fellowship of similar city slickers.Tuolumne Meadows is not a single meadow but a series of meadows formed from the shallow lakes left by the Tuolumne Glacier when it receded three million years ago. The great glacier filled these meadows to a depth of 2,000 feet, cutting deep cirques into the sides of the highest peaks and leaving the sharp crest we\u2019ll see on our trip. Other peaks were completely covered with ice, then rounded and polished by the glacier as it moved. When the ice retreated, these massive domes were left in its wake.Parts of Tuolumne Meadows were trading grounds for several American Indian tribes for almost a thousand years. Their last meeting here was before 1900, but you can sometimes find chips of obsidian left by an arrow maker or discover a grinding hole at the base of a dome or in a meadow boulder.From our base at 7,600 feet elevation, we\u2019ll revisit the area chosen by William Colby for the first Sierra Club outing in 1901. Through our daily excursions and evening fellowship, we\u2019ll experience the excitement and enchantment felt by those first campers to the beautiful area.

Then we will enter Yosemite National Park for our first hike. We will hike the Lower Gaylor Lake Trail. This is a hike to a small but highly picturesque lake, with mountains along the north shore, a meadow as big as the lake spreading away to the south and west, and views beyond the lake and meadow to Mammoth Peak. The distance is 4.6 miles round trip, with 800 feet of total elevation gain.Day 3:\u00a0Our hike today will be two different sites. First we will hike to Lembert Dome, which is 2.8 miles roundtrip and a 900-foot elevation gain. This is a mountain that, like Half Dome, was formed by the movement of glaciers. We will then drive to Lyell Canyon Trail, which is also the Pacific Crest Trail, where we will follow the Tuolumne River through meadows and thick groves of forest.\u00a0 We will hike 3-4 miles and return via the same trail. This hike is mostly flat.Day 4:\u00a0Cathedral Lakes Trail will be the hike today; it is 7-8 miles with 1,000 feet of elevation change. We can hike to the Lower Cathedral Lake, which has an area for swimming. The Upper Cathedral Lake is another \u00bd mile on the trail. This trail is also part of the John Muir Trail, so we will encounter other hikers that are backpacking to the Sunrise High Sierra Camp. About 20,000 years ago, the Cathedral Peaks were above the Tioga Glacier, so instead of getting smoothed and rounded by the ice they are sharper and pointier.\u00a0 After our hike we will drive past Tenaya Lake to Olmsted Point.\u00a0 Here you get a view of Yosemite Valley and the massive space the park encompasses.Day 5: Elizabeth Lake will be today\u2019s hike. The hike is 4.6 miles to the edge of the lake and then another mile if you hike around the lake. There is a great sandy area for swimming, but the water is rather cool. You will be at 9,500 feet elevation and have gained 900 feet to get to the lake. The lake sits in a bowl ringed by evergreens and bordered on one or two sides by granite peaks. Unicorn Peak rises in steep fashion at the edge of the lake. After the hike we will stop at the Visitor\u2019s Center where maps and other items can be bought. There is also a general store nearby for an ice cream stop.Day 6:\u00a0The last hike is the longest and most challenging: Glen Aulin Camp to the Tuolumne Falls and White Cascade Falls. The distance is 13 miles round trip to the High Sierra Camp. The first three miles follow the Tuolumne River, but then the trail begins to climb and the path gets rockier; hiking sticks are helpful.\u00a0 We will also visit Parson Lodge at the start of the hike. It is an old lodge built by the Sierra Club before Yosemite was a national park; it is used today as a visitors' lodge.Day 7:\u00a0Over our final breakfast together, we\u2019ll swap tales and bid farewell to our newest friends, pack up, and break camp.

The training lasts for approximately six months. During the first five months, each trainee designs, plans, and submits his\/her own National Outing and then develops a meal plan and practices screening participants for that trip. This work is done by the trainee at home and under the guidance of a mentor. The training then culminates in five days of hands-on training in the field under the direction of several trainers.This website provides a picture of what this training is about, who should apply, what to expect, plus lots more. In applying for this trip, you will be putting yourself in the company of a dedicated group of volunteer leaders offering some of the best outings in the world. There\u2019s a lot of information here. Please read it in detail to assess whether this training is right for you.\u00a0The TrainingThe home phase of the training will be conducted from January 1, 2018 \u2013 June 30, 2018.\u00a0The hands-on field training will be conducted July 15 \u2013 July 20, 2018 in the northern section of the Green Mountain National Forest (GMNF). The GMNF's diverse landscapes range from rugged, exposed heights on the ridges to quiet, secluded hollows. Vermont's National Forest was established in 1932 in response to the environmental damage caused by the unregulated logging that had been occurring in the uplands for a century.\u00a0Over the last 75 years, much of\u00a0the forested landscape has been nurtured back to health while remaining a working forest.The northern section of GMNF is about 1 \u00bd hours from Burlington, VT. The GMNF is recognized as an area of significant ecological diversity in Vermont and northern New England. The GMNF includes over 400,000 acres of mostly forested land, and includes at least 69 unique natural communities. These communities range from small emergent marsh wetlands to stately stands of hemlock; from common communities, such as northern hardwood forests, to rare communities, such as the small alpine meadow at the summit of Mount Abraham. While much of the\u00a0GMNF\u00a0is dominated by maturing forests of between 70-120 years old, open wetlands, rocky outcrops, and cliffs comprise about 7,000 acres, or close to 2% of the Forest. All of these natural communities are nested within 16 landscapes and 5 biophysical regions in Vermont. These natural communities, landscapes, and biophysical regions provide a wide variety of habitats for native plants and animals, some of which are rare, threatened, or endangered. Some of the characteristic mammals include moose, black bear, red fox, snowshoe hare, porcupine, beaver, bobcat, fisher, coyotes, and many more. In addition, the Long Trail is in the GMNF and is the oldest long-distance trail in the U.S.The GMNF is a great place to learn how to become a Sierra Club leader and this trip will be especially good for learning basecamp planning and organizing, hiking leadership, and service trip skills. On day 1, we will set up a basecamp at a group campsite near Silver Lake. Days 2 \u2013 5, we will be working with the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) to make improvements in the GMNF. The work can range from building new bridges to repairing campsites to doing trail work. Each day, the Leaders of the Day will work with USFS staff to plan the work for the day, organize the team, and lead the activities. This work will be challenging yet rewarding as we see the results of our labor to improve this beautiful area for future generations. On the last day, the field trainers will provide individualized feedback and review for each trainee.Enroll in the Class of 2018 and join hundreds of other Sierra Club leaders in a 100-year tradition, started by John Muir, to lead people into the most beautiful, inspirational mountains, forests, and deserts in the country to encourage stewardship of these special places. In addition, the friends you\u2019ll make in the Class of 2018 will last for years and be a frequent source of support as you continue your leadership journey.Requirements to ParticipateHave the interest and ability to lead a National Outing at least once every other year, but ideally at least once a year.Register and pay for this training.Fill out and submit an online National Outings Leadership Application (http:\/\/content.sierraclub.org\/outings\/national-outings-leader-application).Participate in interviews with the National Outings Volunteer Interviewer, Sponsoring Subcommittee Chair (or designee), and the leader of the field trip to be accepted to the training.Ideally have previously participated on a National Outing. This is not a requirement, but is strongly recommended. Prior multi-day group outings experience may also be acceptable.Possess the ability to use a computer and the internet on a regular basis to complete Home School, the homework phase of the training. The homework phase of\u00a0the training takes 40-60 hours of time in the five months leading up to the field training. Trainees will learn how to use the Sierra Club's Outings Extranet, the National Outings Training Trip Google Site, and the online National Outings Trip Submission System, and they are expected to become proficient in the use of these three systems.Have the interest and ability to work closely with their Home School Mentor in a professional and timely fashion.Have the ability to backpack up to eight miles per day over rough terrain with a 35-pound backpack.Goal of the Training TripThis training trip is designed to teach the leadership and technical skills you will need to propose, plan, and conduct a National Outing with the field section concentrating on practical field skills. The skills you learn during this trip will apply equally for the different types of National and International Outings that you may choose to lead: backpack, lodge, basecamp, water trips, service, or multi-sport trips. During the training, trainees will:Design and submit (using the National Outings Trip Submission System) an engaging and fiscally realistic outing that furthers the conservation mission of the Sierra Club.Write an engaging brochure that will effectively sell the trip.Plan an appetizing and accommodating menu.Conduct pre-trip interviews with mock sign-ups and accept appropriate participants for the outing.Participate fully in the field section of the training, both as a participant and leader-of-the-day.Demonstrate safety awareness, sound judgment and decision-making as part of the leader-of-the-day team.Demonstrate professional communication skills and maintain professional working relationships with home school mentor, field trainers, fellow trainees and leader-of-the-day leader throughout all of NOTT (home school and field training).Demonstrate the ability to manage all logistical aspects of a full day on a basecamp\/hiking\/service trip. This includes Leave No Trace, route finding, hazard assessment, and group energy level assessment, etc.About National OutingsWith more than 100 years of wilderness travel experience, and as a part of the largest grassroots conservation organization in the country, Sierra Club Outings offers more than 350 trips annually to unique destinations around the world. We aim to provide a variety of quality outdoor adventures for people of all ages. Our offerings include adventures in the U.S., Canada, and abroad, including backpacking, base camping, canoeing, kayaking, bicycling, rafting, sailing, skiing, snowshoeing, day hiking, service trips, lodge trips, and family vacations; domestic trips are generally 5\u201310 days in length, while international trips may last up to three weeks. National Outings provides services to about 4,000 participants per year. The 350 trips per year are led by approximately 500 volunteer leaders supported by a small staff in the Outings Department at the Club\u2019s headquarters in Oakland, California. Trips are priced for the program to operate on a long-term, break-even basis.The Ideal of Being a National Outings Leader: The opportunity to follow John Muir\u2019s example and inspire someone to make huge strides in protecting the natural world. The chance to share a remote, pristine, inspiring spot in the wilderness. At parties, you get to say \u201cYes, I\u2019m a leader for the world\u2019s oldest, largest and most effective environmental organization: The Sierra Club.\u201dThe Reality of being a National Outings Leader: Actually, these ideals can be the reality. However, the adage \u201cthere\u2019s no free ride\u201d is especially true. Becoming a volunteer leader for Sierra Club Outings takes loads of lead time, commitment, and training. For more than 100 years, we\u2019ve been offering wilderness trips, led by dedicated volunteers, to educate people about the need for protection of natural resources, and we\u2019ve developed procedures to ensure our trips are safe and successful. We\u2019re dependent on these volunteers, who are organized into subcommittees that are responsible for all offerings in their geographic area or their type of trip. For example, there are subcommittees for California backpacking, for the Southwest, for Alaska, and for Water trips in the West. There are 18 different committees in all, and many have their own set of special qualifications or requirements for leadership and for approval of proposed outings. While undeniably a lot of work, you\u2019ll find the rewards far exceed your efforts. Our training trip will take you through the process step by step, and give you lots of hands-on experiences and case studies to improve your skills and help you gain confidence.Upon successful completion, there are additional measures to ensure you\u2019re not thrown into a sink-or-swim situation. You may become a trainee or assistant on a trip and work with an experienced leader who will mentor you and provide answers to your questions about setting up a successful, enjoyable, safe, AND inspirational outing.CurriculumWe will cover the following curricula:Working with the office staff and volunteer leadershipTrip PlanningSafety ManagementParticipant Welcoming and Pre-Trip ScreeningInterpersonal Leadership SkillsGroup ManagementDecision Making and Problem SolvingWilderness Emergency ManagementNutrition and Food PlanningConservation through OutingsCultural History of the area we are travelling inNatural History of the area we are travelling inEquipment and Clothing SelectionHealth and Sanitation & HygieneCommon Medical Problems and PreventionLightening Safety and PreparednessLeave No TraceWater Purification & How-ToWeather and Weather PredictionThe ProjectThe actual details of the work to be performed will be finalized as we get closer to the trip dates.

There is considerable work to be done before the field section. 80% of the work is in the planning and preparation and 20% is in the actual field time. The homework phase of the training takes 40-60 hours of time during the 5 months prior to the field trip, with deadlines specifically planned to meet volunteer\/staff leadership and Sierra magazine schedules--EXPANDFROMHERE--. The training is conducted in the same way you will plan your future National outing:Due 5 Months before the Field Trip: Trip Expression of Interest, Title and CopyYou will work with your Home School Mentor to decide on the overarching trip plan you are considering. Your Home School Mentor will \"approve\" your outing in the same way that your National Outings Subcommittee Chair would. Additionally, you will craft your trip title and 30-60 word trip copy (for Sierra magazine).Due 4 Months before the Field Trip: Trip BudgetNow you will organize and plan out the actual costs of your trip in addition to finalizing your 30-60 word trip copy. You will submit this information using our online trip submission system and receive your trip budget with feedback from your mentor.Due 3 Months before the Field Trip: Trip BrochureYou will now have the chance to write the online trip brochure (same format as this one) for your trip. Your homework mentor will work with you to refine your drafts.Due 2 Months before the Field Trip: Food PlanningPlanning healthy and exciting meals for your mock trip is the most challenging step for most new leaders. You will have the chance to work with your homework mentor to develop and refine your menu, recipe document, and shopping list.Due 1 Month before the Field Trip: Participant Welcoming & Pre-Trip ScreeningDuring this final homework step, you will welcome and screen at least two mock trip participants for your trip and decide whether to accept them or not.Due shortly before the Field Trip: Leader of the Day (LOD) PlanningYou will spend time with your LOD partner(s) to discuss how you two will work together on the field trip during your one day of leadership. This will be guided by a \u201cGetting Acquainted\u201d exercise that many leaders find helpful when working with someone new. Other planning tasks include drafting a Safety Management Plan for your designed trip and planning, buying, packing and bringing to food for the group on your LOD day. Upon training completion you will be reimbursed for the food costs in the same way that trip leaders are.Field TripThe field trip is an immersion in Sierra Club best practices. Three veteran trainers will guide eight prospective leaders through all aspects of planning, preparing, and leading national outings. Although this is a basecamp\/hiking\/service training trip, lessons learned are appropriate to all Sierra Club trips. Regardless of the style of Sierra Club trip you want to lead, this trip is for you.During each of four days in the field, two trainees will be Leaders of the Day, responsible for all aspects of the day, from safety management to morale. The days are long and full, and the trip is physically and mentally demanding. You will receive ongoing verbal feedback while hiking, at a nightly debrief, in a personal development plan at the end of the trip, and in a close relationship with other Sierra Club leaders in the years ahead.The goal is to build your skills and leadership, and to ensure ongoing support through mentors and other Sierra Club resources, so that you are confident and comfortable to lead Sierra Club trips to help others Explore, Enjoy and Protect the Planet.After Home School and Field TripWhat the trainers will do: Upon successful completion of this training, the trainers will submit a \"Training Trip and Trainee Summary\" (based on everyone\u2019s Leadership Development Plans) to each of the 18 subcommittee chairs who manage the 350 outings each year. Specific subcommittee staffing decisions are made by the subcommittee chair, not the Home School Mentors or Field Trainers. This summary will include a description of the training, what your strengths and areas of growth are, what subcommittees you are interested in, and what leadership role the trainers feel you are ready for (e.g. trainee, assistant, provisional leader, or needing more technical or leadership experience).What you will do: You will receive a written Leadership Development Plan during your development plan meeting. This will highlight what you do well, what you need to work on, which subcommittees you might fit best in, and what roles these might be (based on your interests). About one month after the training trip, you should contact the subcommittee chairs (allowing them time to receive and digest the Training Trip Summary) to express your interest in leading and determining your next step.\u00a0 Your placements will be based on your specific skill set, training trip performance and your time availability. We will also do our\u00a0best to take into consideration your desired geographic location and\/or activity type.","leader1":"Mark Nelson","leader2":"Rebecca Dameron","leader3":"Kevin Breen"}},{"trip":{"title":"Service with the Seven Devils, Hells Canyon Wilderness, Idaho","id":"18270A","dates":"Jul 15, 2018 to Jul 21, 2018","destination":"United States, Idaho","type":"Service\/Volunteer","group":"","difficulty":"","priceHigh":"595","priceLow":"595","image":{"src":"https:\/\/content.sierraclub.org\/outings\/sites\/content.sierraclub.org.outings\/files\/styles\/trip-teaser\/public\/trips\/main-images\/16257_1_Kathleen%20Maier.jpg?itok=6ZDEg9uC","alt":""},"path":"\/outings\/service-hells-canyon-wilderness-idaho#trip=18270A","overview":"The Sharon Churchwell Fund is offering\u00a0adults 18-35 years old a full $300 off this trip.\u00a0Visit our\u00a0scholarships page\u00a0to apply.The TripAre you in good physical shape?

Expect to be pleasantly surprised by the wide range of experiences, personalities, lifestyles, and fields of interest that participants bring to this trip.The ruggedly scenic Seven Devils Mountains of Nez Perce tribal legend guard the Idaho side of the Snake River, dividing the Snake and Salmon River drainages. Looming high above Hells Canyon, these mountains have forbidding names: The Ogre, The Goblin, She Devil, and He Devil -- the highest peak, topping out at 9,393 feet. Though the name Seven Devils is thought to derive from the Native American name for the area, more recent explorers and climbers named the individual peaks.The Seven Devils Mountains are remote and wild, a great example of the best experience that wilderness has to offer. Access is limited to horseback and foot traffic, giving visitors, including ourselves, an opportunity to experience a place still relatively pristine and unchanged by human impact. High alpine forests and meadows dominate the area where we\u2019ll be hiking and working. As we\u2019ll be visiting at the perfect time for wildflowers, we can expect to see wildflowers such as penstemon, lupine, Indian paintbrush, and sego lilies on display. While these mountains are home to elk, deer, black bears, and even mountain lions, their cautious nature means that they\u2019re more likely to see us than we are to see them, but if we\u2019re lucky we may catch sight of mountain goats or even bighorn sheep.The ProjectThe project will focus on clearing downfall along the Seven Devils Loop Trail using crosscut saws. Depending on our progress, we may also clear other trail sections in the Basin Lake area of Hells Canyon Wilderness. Details on the specific project will be updated as the trip date nears, and are always subject to change as conditions in the field may require. Since the project is within a wilderness area, we will be using only hand-operated tools and there will be no use of motorized equipment. We will also be emphasizing Leave No Trace ethics.","highlights":"Use a crosscut saw to open up blocked trails, Base camp under 9,000-foot peaks of the Seven Devils, Search for mountain goats, bighorn sheep, and more","includes":"  All meals and snacks,   Project tools and instruction,   Pack support for tools, cooking equipment, and food","itinerary":"The trip officially starts on Sunday, but we suggest you camp or find other accomodations relatively close to the trailhead the night before (Saturday).

The way in will be a fairly strenuous six-mile backpack from our trailhead to our base camp. We will hike together as a group, taking rest stops and a break for lunch. There are many steep uphill climbs as we ascend to our base camp, so we will need to be in good shape! The Forest Service will provide a horse-pack train to carry our group food and kitchen equipment. However, each of us will be responsible for backpacking in our own personal clothing and camping gear. Our backcountry campsite for six days will have no amenities, except those that we pack in ourselves--EXPANDFROMHERE--.Day two is our first work day. Our plan will be to work two days, take Wednesday off for activities of our choice (hiking, swimming, fishing, or just relaxing at camp), and then work another two days. Our workdays will start after an early breakfast, and we\u2019ll generally be back in camp by 4 or 4:30 p.m., with a little time to clean up and relax before dinner. Depending on where along the trail we are working on any given day, we may spend up to three or even four hours hiking from base camp to and from the day\u2019s worksite.The last trip-provided meal is the hike-out lunch on Saturday, the last listed trip day. Do not plan to fly home on that Saturday, since we cannot be certain when we'll arrive back at the trailhead. Do plan to attend a Dutch-treat, good-bye dinner in Riggins that evening.Several weeks before the trip, the leader will send all trip members an email newsletter with all the last-minute details.

The park has a great trail system for our access to the wilderness.The Elwha River restoration project, which started in 2011, is the largest dam removal in the history of the United States. The dam removal will allow the Elwha River to flow freely from its headwaters in the Olympic Mountains to the Strait of Juan de Fuca for the first time in 100 years. As the river finds its natural course, salmon will once again have access to 70 river miles of habitat that is within the Olympic National Park. The river's course has been changing monthly, but already chinook salmon, pink salmon, and native steelhead have moved above the Elwha Dam site.

Our hike back results in a total trek of seven to eight miles, with an elevation gain of approximately 1,700 feet over rocky terrain.If time permits, those interested in soaking and swimming in the Sol Duc Resort Hot Springs after our hike may do so.Day 4:\u00a0We'll meet at our school minibus after breakfast and drive to Rialto Beach where you will immediately be treated to the sights of crashing waves, drift wood, sea stacks, and tide pools. This is a great place to walk the cobbled beach to look for bald eagles, brown pelicans, and other shore birds.Day 5:\u00a0After our breakfast, we will board the bus with a destination of Hurricane Ridge. This hike will be a sharp contrast to the lush rainforest as we trek through mountain meadows and ridges. The vistas are beautiful and breathtaking, with mountain ranges and water as the backdrop. Those who choose to can hike an additional one mile, with a climb of 800 feet, to reach Klahhane Ridge. Once at the top, the views will amaze you! Or else, you may choose to find a comfortable spot on the mountain to sit, relax, and enjoy the view before we start our trek down. In the event that there is a late snow melt, we will hike as far as we can and then have fun playing in the snowfields.Please note: These particular trails may not be appropriate for people with a fear of heights or who have balance problems. The trails are narrow and hug sharp knife edge mountain sides. They are perfectly safe for most participants, so are included in the itinerary.We will enjoy our last evening around the campfire, celebrating new friendships and sharing highlights of the trip.Day 6:\u00a0Today, we will culminate our trip with a firsthand look and exploration of the Elwha River Valley, specifically the locations of the dam removal and river restoration sites. We will get a look at the upper dam sites, and then travel midway down the river and explore the location of the river as it has carved its new path. The river restoration project has afforded us the unique opportunity to see how extremely large the trees were around 1913 at the time the dam was built. You'll be able to imagine the Klallam people and their way of life along the river before they lost access to the salmon that made their way up the river to spawn.The final journey along the Elwha River will take us to the mouth of the river and The Straits of Juan de Fuca. The water is beautiful here, with multiple seabirds gracing the waves. You'll witness how the dam removal and resulting sediment have changed the river bed and surrounding Straits area where new sandbars have developed and shrubbery has started to root.\u00a0Our trip will end at approximately 1:30 p.m. when we will say our goodbyes from the trailhead and depart for home. Those needing to fly home on Friday should plan their flights after 8:00 p.m. to allow travel time to Seattle.","leader1":"Tonya Grace Burchette","leader2":"Ann Daigle","leader3":""}},{"trip":{"title":"Dolomites Sampler, Part A: The Good Life, Italy","id":"18680A","dates":"Jul 16, 2018 to Jul 22, 2018","destination":"Europe, Italy","type":"International","group":"","difficulty":"","priceHigh":"2195","priceLow":"2195","image":{"src":"https:\/\/content.sierraclub.org\/outings\/sites\/content.sierraclub.org.outings\/files\/styles\/trip-teaser\/public\/trips\/main-images\/18680_7_GeneGoldberg.jpg?itok=9AIHWGLc","alt":""},"path":"\/outings\/dolomites-sampler-italy#trip=18680A","overview":"The TripThe Dolomites are famous for their surreal beauty, with rugged white, gray, and pink peaks rising abruptly from rolling green valleys and meadows. Geologically they have strong contrasts, being composed of both dolomitic limestone and volcanic formations. The cultural heritage of the area also has contrasts; with Italian, Ladin, and Tyrolean influences. In fact, most villages and towns have three names, in Italian, German, and Ladin. The Ladins were in the region before the Romans came and were never totally absorbed. The thousands of years of human occupation have left their mark on the land, an impact we will acquire firsthand knowledge of. We will be hiking beneath the peaks in two of the principle valleys of the Dolomites: the Val Gardena, heavily Tyrolean; and Val Badia, a primarily Ladin area--EXPANDFROMHERE--.\u00a0Carrying only our day packs (taxis will transport our luggage when necessary), we\u2019ll be free to hike and enjoy the scenery, wildflowers, and villages of this captivating and historical area. Our experiences here will be made extra special by the welcoming and friendly nature of the people of this relatively remote and beautiful region of Italy.This is the first of a two-part adventure. This one, Part A \u2013 The Good Life, is hotel based. We will be staying in four-star hotels and taking moderate day hikes. When we move to a different hotel, a taxi will take our luggage for us.

Arrive early and you can visit the South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology (not included) and see its fascinating exhibit on\u00a0\u00d6tzi, the Iceman, whose 5,300-year-old frozen body was discovered not far from here in 1991. After meeting, we'll walk to a nearby restaurant for our orientation meeting and a traditional Tyrolean dinner--EXPANDFROMHERE--.\u00a0Day 2:\u00a0Leaving right after breakfast, we'll board an inter-city bus for the 1.5-hour ride to the outskirts of Selva-Wolkenstein in Val Gardena. Here we take a lift up onto the flanks of Cirspitzen, one of the taller peaks in the Puez-Odle Natural Park. Then we take a short walk to a mountain hut (rifugio\u00a0in Italian), where we eat lunch. Along the way, enjoy the views down into the Gardena Valley. Then it's a downhill walk into the village and to our four-star hotel. We should arrive in time to enjoy the spa! 4 miles; up 300 feet, down 2,000 feet.\u00a0Day 3:\u00a0Today we walk from the hotel, heading up the Val Lunga (Long Valley). At the lower elevations, where our trail is, the valley is forested. Rising above the trees, we can admire the flanks of the bare rock mountain as the valley penetrates into the heart of Cirspitzen. The trail goes up the valley at a steady, but not steep, rate. We go only as far up the valley as we wish, then return by the same route. If we go all the way to where the trail becomes steep, it's 8 miles, 1,400 feet up and down.Day 4:\u00a0Taking a lift from the center of town, we go up onto the northern shoulder of Sasso Lungo (Long Rock). With the huge mass of the mountain towering on our left and the wooded hillside sloping down on the right, our trail stays mostly along the border of \u00a0forest and rock as we contour around the mountain. Along the way we'll have a picnic lunch and maybe stop at a rifugio for some refreshments. 7 miles; up 1,200 feet, down 2,800 feet.\u00a0Day 5:\u00a0A short, free ride on a shuttle van in Wolkenstein takes us up the steep hill to the Dantercepies lift.\u00a0Meanwhile a taxi will bring our luggage to our new hotel in Corvara.\u00a0On board the gondola, we're whisked 2,100 feet up and almost two miles closer to our destination for the day. From the top of the lift we begin hiking, mostly level for a while and then descending. Through gaps in the trees we'll have views of Piz Bo\u00e9, 10,250 feet, across the valley below. Want to walk up it? Then come on Part B! 5.5 miles; up 600 feet, down 2,900 feet. (There is a lift at the end that could save 500 feet of descent, but it doesn't always run.)Day 6:\u00a0Today's hike will be very different; instead of going into the rocky limestone mountains, we'll stay on a rolling, high-altitude meadow, the Pralongia Alp. Most people think \"alp\" is a mountain, but actually it means a high meadow in the mountains. After all, the dairy farmers were much more interested in the meadows than the peaks. Rifugi are dotted across the alp and connected by dirt roads, which mostly will be our trails today, as we have a more relaxed pace for our final day of hiking. 7 miles; up 1,000 feet, down 2,400 feet. Again, we may be able to find a lift to reduce the downhill part.Day 7:\u00a0After breakfast, transfer by inter-city bus back to Bolzano where the trip ends.","leader1":"Gene Goldberg","leader2":"Steve Welter","leader3":""}},{"trip":{"title":"Alpine Exhilaration in the Wild Rubies of Eastern Nevada","id":"18177A","dates":"Jul 16, 2018 to Jul 21, 2018","destination":"United States, Nevada","type":"Base Camp","group":"","difficulty":"","priceHigh":"1075","priceLow":"1075","image":{"src":"https:\/\/content.sierraclub.org\/outings\/sites\/content.sierraclub.org.outings\/files\/styles\/trip-teaser\/public\/trips\/main-images\/18177_main_DavidvonSeggern.jpg?itok=3uSy4EN5","alt":"Alpine Exhilaration in the Wild Rubies of Eastern Nevada"},"path":"\/outings\/alpine-exhilaration-rubies-eastern-nevada#trip=18177A","overview":"The TripExperience an alpine oasis in the high desert of eastern Nevada's Great Basin.

In 2017, heavy snowfalls and late snow melts affected our choice of trails, and Forest Service rangers directed to us to avoid some areas because of environmental concerns. Late summer 2017 brought several large forest fires -- the effects of which continue to alter the landscape. We will be mindful of these elements as we adjust our itinerary from the tentative plans outlined here.Day 1: The trip begins on Monday in Portland, Oregon. (If you fly to Portland, Maine, you are on your own!) Trip leaders will pick up participants mid-morning at a central location. Participants must discuss travel plans and timing with leaders before making airplane reservations, so that we can leave Portland on time; most participants will need to fly to Portland on Sunday.

If we\u2019re lucky, the meadow on Hawk Mountain will be covered with wildflowers. Total hike is about 5 miles.Day 3: Today\u2019s hike is along the Little North Santiam River. We walk through a mossy, old-growth forest, watching the river transition from rapids to waterfalls to calm, emerald-colored pools of crystal-clear water. Although the hike is described as 4.5 miles with 900 feet elevation gain, the uneven trail makes it seem longer -- making it a real treat to swim in one of those emerald pools around lunchtime.Day 4: After three days of shorter hikes, we\u2019re ready for something more ambitious \u00ad-- a 9-mile hike along the Old Cascade Crest Trail, with 2,200 feet of elevation gain. We begin in woods full of bunchberry, cross a creek, and then begin switchbacking up a steep hill. Before the climb becomes too tiring, we emerge into meadows full of wildflowers, with dramatic views of the higher Cascade Mountains in the distance. At the summit of Crescent Mountain, our 180-degree view includes Mount Hood, Mount Jefferson, Three-Fingered Jack, Mount Washington, and the Three Sisters. After returning to our vehicles, those who have the energy part way through the return drive can take a \u00bd-mile walk onto a large lava field.Day 5: Perhaps a little fatigued after yesterday\u2019s hike, we have a day to relax and enjoy the retreat center where we\u2019re staying. In addition to the soaking pools and some cold creeks to dip in, there are optional classes such as yoga -- some at no charge. Those who want a massage (extra cost) are advised to book several weeks in advance. There are also options for hikes starting at the lodge, including the six-mile South Breitenbush Gorge Trail.Day 6: After our rest day, we\u2019re ready for another energetic hike, to Red Lake and Potato Butte. We begin by briefly crossing a clearcut, then climbing through old-growth forest. In less than two miles we reach Red Lake, a shallow lake with a small beach. We continue past three other lakes before summitting Potato Butte, with a great view of Mount Jefferson and the lakes below. This 7.2-mile hike includes 1,700 feet of elevation gain.Day 7: We have a leisurely morning for a farewell soak in the hot springs before we pack up and head back to Portland. We\u2019ll be back in Portland late afternoon on Sunday. A late-Sunday plane departure may be feasible; please discuss with trip leader before making reservations.Note: In order to visit these diverse ecosystems, we will need to drive longer-than-usual distances to the trailheads.

Our hotel is the historic Kvikne's Hotel, which dates back to 1877.Balestrand lies between towering, snow-covered mountains and the majestic Sognefjord in a beautiful and lush fjord landscape. The impressive scenery and the constantly changing light brought many painters here to capture the fascinating play of light on canvas. This afternoon we will have a short orientation to Kvikne's Hotel and Balestrand, eat a simple lunch at one of the quaint fjord-side restaurants, and take a short, warm-up hike in the forested area above Balestrand.Dinner tonight is Kvikne's famous sm\u00f8rg\u00e5sbord -- a huge selection of Norwegian specialties, including salads and hot and cold entrees, featuring meats, fish, cheeses, vegetables, and more, and fabulous desserts.Day 3:\u00a0Balestrand: Cider House Farm.\u2028 After your sm\u00f8rg\u00e5sbord breakfast, we have a brief introduction to the history of Balestrand and then walk to the Sogn Fruit Farm and Cider House. The Cider House includes an orchard with many apple varieties and beautiful views. We will have a personal presentation of their farm and cider production, followed by lunch. You have many choices for our afternoon, which include exploring Balestrand on your own, hiking with your leaders, or perusing quaint shops. At the local grocery store, each of us will get supplies for tomorrow\u2019s lunch. Dinner and overnight at Kvikne's Hotel.Day 4:\u00a0Balestrand to Luster.\u2028 After a leisurely breakfast, we will depart about 9:30 a.m. by private mini-bus for Leikanger and our lodgings at Nes G\u00e5rd, a bed-and-breakfast guesthouse. Before arriving at Nes G\u00e5rd, we hike up Molden Mountain, located on a peninsula, which affords a panoramic view of Lusterfjord. The hike leads up through a forested area then through an area of broad stones. At the summit, we relax, have our lunch, and enjoy the views before returning by the same route to our awaiting bus for the short drive on to Nes G\u00e5rd. Molden Mountain's summit is at 3,670 feet. The hike ascends 1,700 feet.Norway's longest and deepest fjord, the Sognefjord, lies in the heart of Fjord Norway and extends more than 200 miles inland. The Lusterfjord is an arm of the Sognefjord, surrounded by the glaciers and high mountains of the Jotunheimen and Jostedalsbreen national parks. Along both shores of the fjord are villages and lush landscapes where fruits and berries grow on small, idyllic farms.Nes G\u00e5rd overlooks the Lusterfjord, with newly renovated rooms in the traditional farmhouse dating to the 1850s and adjacent buildings. We'll enjoy four day-hikes on good trails through a magnificent green landscape, with thundering waterfalls, lonely homesteads, and summer farms up in the mountains. Please note that the following proposed daily hiking itinerary is subject to adjustment, depending on safety considerations at the time, including weather, trail conditions, and other factors. Dinner and overnight at Nes G\u00e5rd.Day 5:\u00a0Hike Vigdal - Navarsete (five hours).\u2028 Today\u2019s hike passes the mountain farm Vigdalst\u00f8l and Fivlenosi, 4,000 feet above sea level, with a view of the Jostedal Glacier, which is the largest glacier in continental Europe. Our hike continues down through the green valley of Engedalen. We\u2019ll have ascended 1,700 feet and descended 1,800 by the end of the day. Dinner and overnight at Nes G\u00e5rd.Day 6:\u00a0Hike Morkridsdalen Valley.\u2028 We drive to the upper end of Lusterfjord and into Breheimen National Park. Hiking up the Morkridsdalen Valley, we enjoy close-up views of a glacial river and then walk past a lovely lake. After a steep but short climb, our path goes through a park-like landscape until we reach the summer farm buildings and pastures at Dulsete, where we enjoy our lunch. We then continue up the valley to view several waterfalls before hiking down for our return to Nes G\u00e5rd. This hike is tremendously varied in terrain, vegetation, and viewpoints.\u00a0 Estimated distance is six to eight miles with 500-800 feet of elevation gain. Dinner and overnight at Nes G\u00e5rd.Day 7:\u00a0Jostedalsbreen National Park: Jostedal Glacier - Valley of Krundalen.\u2028 Almost half of the Jostedalsbreen National Park is covered by the Jostedal Glacier. Today we'll experience the glacier up close. First, we follow a river on a relatively flat trail for an hour and a half up the Krundalen Valley to a viewpoint that overlooks the hanging Bergset glacier (Bergsetbreen), one of several arms of the Jostedalbreem. The glacier arm drops sheer down the mountain face, an imposing sight. Afterward, we will visit Nigardsbreen (Nigards Glacier), one of the more impressive of Jostedal Glacier's 22 arms.\u00a0 We'll travel by boat across the lake, where we can walk right up to the glacier. We\u2019ll have lunch at the glacier's terminal moraine as we admire the blue-ice glacier a short distance from where we sit. Afterward, if time permits, we will take an afternoon walk in a nearby valley or visit the Breheimen Glacier Museum. Return to Nes G\u00e5rd for dinner and overnight.Day 8:\u00a0Explore the Lusterfjord, including Urnes Stave Church.\u2028 Today we set off for a full day of cultural and sightseeing activities around the scenic Lusterfjord. We first visit the idyllic village of Solvorn not far from Nes G\u00e5rd. From Solvorn we take a small ferry across the Lusterfjord to visit the Urnes Stave Church, built around 1150. Norway's oldest stave church,\u00a0Urnes Stave Church\u00a0is featured on the UNESCO World Heritage List. (Stave churches are an early type of heavy timber construction.)\u00a0 After lunch, we hike to a scenic viewpoint overlooking the Lusterfjord (about four miles and 1,000 feet of elevation gain), complete our full-circle drive around the Lusterfjord, and return to Nes G\u00e5rd for dinner and overnight.Day 9:\u00a0Luster to Oslo.\u2028 Today, we transfer by private van to Fl\u00e5m, about an hour away. We then depart on the Fl\u00e5m Railway (Fl\u00e5msbana). Widely regarded as one of the most exciting train trips in Europe, it is one of the world's steepest standard-gauge railways, with a gradient of 5.5% as we ascend to the village of Myrdal. From Myrdal we continue on the Bergen Railway (Northern Europe's highest altitude rail line), traveling across the mountains -- the \"Roof of Norway\" -- and arrive in Oslo in early evening. We transfer to our Oslo hotel for the next two nights.Day 10:\u00a0Oslo City Tour. \u2028After our sm\u00f8rg\u00e5sbord breakfast, we will enjoy a full day of activities in Oslo, Norway\u2019s capital city. Our local guide will present information on Norway's history, culture, and social system. We\u2019ll use a variety of local public transportation options (tram, bus and ferry) to visit selected sites. During our exploration in Oslo, our guide will point out important buildings, including Parliament, the King\u2019s Palace, and the National Theater. We will visit City Hall (site of the annual Nobel Peace Prize ceremony) and the Vigeland Sculpture Park (also called Frogner Park), which features works in bronze and granite by sculptor Gustav Vigeland. After a casual lunch, we\u2019ll visit the Viking Ship Museum, which houses two restored Viking ships and some of the treasures that had been buried with them. There are many options for the remainder of the afternoon, including the Norwegian Folk Museum, the Thor Heyerdahl Kon-Tiki Museum, the Nobel Peace Center, the National Gallery, and the Norwegian Resistance Museum. This evening we will meet for our farewell dinner and share thoughts and recollections about our trip.Day 11:\u00a0Depart from Oslo. \u2028After breakfast, you can take a convenient bus to the Oslo airport -- or extend your stay in Norway!","leader1":"Hurston Roberts","leader2":"Pritpal Singh Kochhar","leader3":""}},{"trip":{"title":"Service in the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness, Montana and Idaho","id":"18271A","dates":"Jul 21, 2018 to Jul 28, 2018","destination":"United States, Montana","type":"Service\/Volunteer","group":"","difficulty":"4 (out of 5)","priceHigh":"675","priceLow":"675","image":{"src":"https:\/\/content.sierraclub.org\/outings\/sites\/content.sierraclub.org.outings\/files\/styles\/trip-teaser\/public\/trips\/main-images\/17263_1_JamesPhernetto.jpg?itok=1tue9Ns1","alt":""},"path":"\/outings\/service-wilderness-montana-idaho#trip=18271A","overview":"The Sharon Churchwell Fund is offering adults 18-35 years old a full $300 off this trip.

The mountains are some of the most rugged in North America, towering over lush forests that include old-growth stands of fir, cedar, pine and larch. In addition to mule deer, moose, bighorn sheep, mountain goat, cougar and black bear populations, this wilderness is home to one of the country\u2019s largest elk herds, and has recently been a site for the re-introduction of the gray wolf into its historic habitat.Idaho\/Montana mountain weather is variable. July days are generally sunny and warm, with substantially cooler temperatures in the evening. Rain in the mountains is always a possibility, so sturdy rain gear is important. There are no poisonous bugs or snakes, and there\u2019s no poison ivy or poison oak. Mosquitoes are a predictable nuisance, however.The ProjectOur work projects yield visible results and are typically varied enough that everyone has a chance to try a range of jobs.

We're dropped at the end of the road, surrounded by miles of rolling green meadows. From here we walk a short way to a small gully, cross the unique wooden bridge, and then proceed up the switchback trail to the top of Mount Schlern. We can look down at the town of Castelrotto below, and then turn east and hike to our first mountain hut (rifugio in Italian). At first the trail is along the ridgetop of the mountain, but after a while we go down into a rocky valley that nearly parallels the ridge.

After a while we slowly work our way higher up the mountain until we finally top a small pass; in the saddle of which is our new rifugio. A high hill is on the right, and the steep slopes of Sasso Piatto are on the left. The rifugio has an excellent restaurant. Overnight in the rifugio. No access to luggage tonight. 7 miles; up 2,000 feet, down 2,500 feet.Day 4:\u00a0Taxis will pick us up and take us to Passo Pordoi where we get the lift up to the flank of Piz Boe, 10,250 feet. We start our hike crossing the open, rocky expanse on the shoulder of the peak, then make the short but steep ascent to the top. The steep last 200 feet involves crossing big boulders. There is a chain at places to provide the added comfort of a hand-hold for those who wish. Then we head down, at one point going down a very steep gully with loose footing for about 200 feet. Then the second half of the day is spent angling down the mountainside. To give our knees a rest, we take a gondola down for the last bit into Corvara. Here our luggage rejoins us as we enjoy the comforts of our four-star hotel. 4.5 miles; up 1,200 feet, down 3,500 feet.Day 5:\u00a0We take another taxi, winding up a narrow country road to our trailhead. Then we climb up a steep slope covered with scree. The footing is loose, but the reward is great as we emerge onto a lunar-like landscape of limestone paving stretching for miles in all directions. \u00a0We are now in the middle of the Puez-Odle Natural Park. This is a very empty stretch, so we'll almost certainly be alone as we walk the now gentler path through the open valley.

Overnight at the rifugio and no access to luggage. 5.5 miles; up 3,000 feet, down 1,800 feet.Day 6:\u00a0We return to the highway by a different and less steep route. Our start is crossing the shallow valley, looking for firm ground on the sometimes boggy soil. Then a half mile of steep but good trail takes us up to a plateau, which we then walk along. With ups and downs, eventually we come to the edge of the plateau and descend a steep, wooded trail back to the road.

We then venture off for three days kayaking along the shores, inlets, and bays of the San Juan Islands. Our destinations will be two other islands, one of which is famous for its shoreline where orca whales are often seen. On each of the days kayaking we will also stop on the islands for hiking and camping. All tents, sleeping bags and meals are prepared for us during these three days. \u00a0We return to San Juan Island to explore and hike the Historical National Park.

Time permitting we will explore the north end of the island, known as \u201cEnglish Camp.\" This is where the Great Britain built a fort in the early 1800s to challenge the United States for who owns the island, thus it is a very important part of the history of the island. On days one and two, we prepare our meals together. The cabins have fully furnished kitchens and a menu is provided with ingredients to provide easy preparation.Day 2:\u00a0We meet at the dock to board the privately chartered boat to travel in search of the orca whales, harbor seals, and other wildlife. On board our naturalist will describe the marine life and geology of this island as we spend 4-5 hours along the coastline looking for the various whales of the Salish Sea.

We will be on the trails at American Camp National Historic Park. This is a remarkable area of the island because it has three distinct ecosystems (forest, prairie, and beach) within one day\u2019s walk. There we will have a park ranger give us a tour of the historical sites in this park where the American Army held its ground to try to keep the island as part of the United States. Other features of this part of the island will be added as time allows. This evening we board the ferry and return to Anacortes.

The annual study conducted in January and February shows the wolf population at its lowest levels since the study began 56 years ago. The moose population has increased to over 700 animals, which is still low from historical standards, and the wolf population was estimated at only nine. We have been lucky enough on previous trips to see moose and hear wolves howling, but it is never a given--EXPANDFROMHERE--.Because of its surface relief and geographic location, Isle Royale supports a diverse flora. Most of the island is forested. Along the cool, moist shoreline you will see trees such as the jack pine and quaking aspen. Common trees on the interior and higher parts of the island include northern red oak, white pine, and big tooth aspen. You will also see smaller plants such as the thimbleberry, which is the most common ground cover on the island, and the tart berries along with wild blueberries should be ready for picking while we are there. Many other wildflowers (including 32 varieties of wild orchids) and raspberries are usually plentiful.The ProjectWe will work alongside and under the direction of the National Park Service trail crew.

How far we get each day and where we camp depends on how we feel, the weather and other factors outside of our control. Flexibility is important. The itinerary described here should be taken as a general plan. The actual route and schedule may well depart from this plan.Day 1:\u00a0The trip will begin with a potluck dinner at 5:00 p.m. on Saturday evening at a campground near Lake Thomas Edison, about 90 miles northeast of Fresno. The evening will be a great time for us to meet our backpacking companions and relax over a meal together before beginning our adventure. We will go over trip procedures, give ourselves one more night to acclimate to the high elevation and finish preparations for our journey.Although the trip begins on Saturday evening, we encourage participants to arrive a day or two early to start acclimatizing to the high elevations we will encounter at the beginning of the trip. Giving your body an extra couple of days to adjust to the high elevation can often make a big difference between enjoying the trip, or merely just enduring it.Day 2:\u00a0We\u2019ll eat an early breakfast at the campground and, after a brief car shuttle, we\u2019ll begin hiking and ascend the Bear Ridge Trail until it joins the famous John Muir and Pacific Crest trails. We\u2019ll turn south on the JMT\/PCT to descend into Bear Creek Canyon, where we\u2019ll search out a nice creek-side campsite along Bear Creek.

The trail eventually peters out and we will continue to find our way off trail into the basin. We\u2019ll spend two nights camping near one of the many lakes, giving us a day to relax, explore or climb a nearby peak.Day 5:\u00a0Our trek continues off trail, always in the shadow of the spectacular east face of Seven Gables peak. Today will be a short hiking day as we meander upward through scenic Bear Lakes Basin to camp near one of its most northerly lakes. We\u2019ll have the afternoon to relax or explore our surroundings.Day 6:\u00a0This is the longest hiking day of our trip. Although we will travel just about 8 miles, our entire route is all off trail. Lighter food weight and nearly a week spent acclimating to the high altitude will assist in making this day enjoyable. Leaving Bear Lakes Basin, we\u2019ll climb off trail to cross a minor pass then wind around the shore of Lake Italy to start a long, rocky climb over Gabbot Pass (12,240 feet). From the pass, we\u2019ll descend along Mills Creek and make camp alongside one of its lakes.Day 7:\u00a0Leaving the lake we\u2019ll follow Mills Creek down the Second Recess of the Mono Divide, where our route once again follows a trail. Crossing Mono Creek, we\u2019ll turn west to reach our last night\u2019s forested campsite.Day 8:\u00a0We\u2019ll rise early so we can catch the morning ferry across Lake Edison and get back to our cars at the Vermillion Valley Resort.

As we approach the lake\u2019s overlook, rich in subalpine vegetation, there is a possibility that mountain goats will be gazing our direction.\u00a0\u00a0As we continue on, we\u2019ll descend 800 feet on a fairly steep switchback trail to the shore of the glacially carved, crystal clear Hidden Lake.The Highline Trail to Haystack Butte, an in\/out hike of 7.2 miles, offers panoramic views of rugged mountain scenery. Passing the Continental Divide sign, we\u2019ll pass through an open area of lush green, looking for Columbian ground squirrels and bachelor bighorn sheep.\u00a0A short section of the trail, approximately 3\/10 of a mile, is a narrow ledge carved into the rock and has a 100-foot dropoff in places to the road below.\u00a0The Park has installed a cable to hold onto if necessary. After that bit of trail excitement, we\u2019ll hike along the side of sloped mountains, continuing our amazing views, looking at colorful wildflowers and perhaps sharing the trail with local Park wildlife. Eventually, the rolling trail will reach a large field of boulders with a mysterious swirl pattern. After stopping to examine the rocks and listen\/look for pica, we\u2019ll follow the switchbacks up, gaining another 300 feet to an even more incredible view.Day 3:\u00a0Today\u2019s trail options afford wildflower and photographic views. The trails to Piegan Pass (9.2 miles, with a 1,700-foot elevation gain) and Siyeh Pass (9 miles with a 2,200-foot elevation gain) is shared for a short distance before it splits.\u00a0\u00a0The beginning of the trail briefly follows Siyeh Creek and then enters a forest of subalpine fir and spruce. As the forest begins to thin out, we\u2019ll arrive at the Siyeh Pass trail junction. For those adventurers traveling to Siyeh Pass, the right fork will lead to Preston Park, a glacially carved valley with an expansive alpine meadow carpeted with wildflowers, dotted with groupings of pine trees, and surrounded by towering peaks.\u00a0\u00a0After crossing the Park, we again ascend up, about 700 feet, navigating a series of switchbacks on a rocky talus slope that leads to a false summit.\u00a0\u00a0From there, after catching our breath and looking for large wildlife, it's another 200 feet up to the pass where we\u2019ll find a heap of ritualist hiker rocks and rewarding views into St. Mary\u2019s Valley.The left fork leads to Piegan Pass. After emerging above the tree line, we'll traverse a barren, rocky area on the slope of Mt. Siyeh, with views of Jackson Glacier and Blackfoot Glacier to the south, and Piegan Glacier to the west. As we continue on, we\u2019ll scan the area for mountain goats and ptarmigan. After reaching our final destination, the saddle between Piegan Mountain and Cataract Mountain, we\u2019ll have our cameras ready for the Garden Wall, the vertical face of Mt. Gould and Many Glacier Valley.Day 4:\u00a0By now you may recognize that a choice between two trail options is difficult in such a scenic Park.\u00a0And today is no easier.\u00a0In the Many Glacier area, prime habitat for bears, the trail to Grinnell Glacier is 11.5 miles round-trip, with a 1,500-foot elevation gain, and Ptarmigan Tunnel is 10.7 miles with a 2,300-foot gain.The first few miles on the trail to Grinnell Glacier roll gently through a forest and past two mountain lakes. As we begin our ascent, stair-stepping under a waterfall, we'll pass colorful rock strata with a view of a turquoise lake below. The higher we climb the more spectacular our view will become. You\u2019ll want to take time to look for bighorn sheep climbing on rocks or laying in a meadow. Our last push will be over a rocky moraine to Upper Grinnell Lake, a milky blue lake formed by the melting glacier. Up until now, we have been learning about climate change and its impact upon glaciers through our on-trail education. Now is our opportunity to see a glacier, stromatolites, and more as we explore this area.The Ptarmigan Tunnel trail ascends the Wilbur Creek Valley, with views of Mt. Grinnel, Swiftcurrent Mountain and Mt. Wilbur. After viewing Ptarmigan Falls, we\u2019ll begin a steeper ascent, passing an area that can be rich in huckleberries, a grizzly favorite.\u00a0 We\u2019ll eventually have a view of the Ptarmigan Wall, an ar\u00eate, rising 1,700 feet above the trail, and cascading falls as we approach colorful Ptarmigan Lake and the switchbacks leading to the tunnel above it.\u00a0 The last push to the historic tunnel, built in the 1930s by the Civilian Conservation Corps, is well worth the effort. There are spectacular views from both ends of the tunnel to include Old Sun Glacier, Belly River, and Elizabeth Lake.Day 5:\u00a0Kick back day has arrived!\u00a0One option, a half-day river float, is not included in the trip price. Last year\u2019s price was $60.00. On the first July trip, (July 14-21) there is a second option in addition to a float.\u00a0\u00a0We\u2019ll do an in\/out hike (approximately 4.5 miles total), along McDonald Creek to see McDonald Falls, Sacred Dancing Cascades, and ponds to look for female Harlequin ducks and moose. Afterward, we\u2019ll have lunch at the head of Lake McDonald and then visit the lodge. Both trips will include time to explore the shops at Apgar Village (and their tasty huckleberry ice cream), located at the southern end of Lake McDonald and not far from our field camp.Day 6:\u00a0Two Medicine Valley, located in the southeast corner of the Park, is today's destination. Considered by the tribes of the Blackfeet Nation to be a place of religious significance, this broad U-shaped valley was scoured by a long-ago glacier. Some of its rugged peaks are the most photographed in the park. The first trail option, Cobalt Lake, is 11.4 miles round-trip, with an elevation gain of 1,400 feet. The trail follows the south shore of Two Medicine Lake, eventually passing beaver ponds, which we\u2019ll be checking out for resident moose. Further along the trail, after having crossed a suspended bridge, we\u2019ll take a few minutes at Rockwell Falls for photo opportunities and looking for dippers (the Audubon, not people, type), before ascending a series of switchbacks with magnificent views to the blue-green Cobalt Lake.The second trail option, Two Medicine Lake Loop, is an approximate 9- to 10-mile hike with an elevation gain of 780 feet. Our trail will follow the north shore of Two Medicine Lake beneath Rising Wolf Mountain. As we pass by avalanche chutes, we\u2019ll have unobstructed views of Never Laughs, Sinopah, and other mountain peaks. As the trail curves at the head of the lake, we\u2019ll take a side trip to view Twin Falls.\u00a0 As we continue our loop, we\u2019ll have more views of a very scenic lake surrounded by massive peaks.\u00a0 We\u2019ll take a side trail to Aster Falls and Aster Park Overlook for a view of the Two Medicine Valley, and then complete our loop.Day 7:\u00a0On our final day, the first hike option is Numa Ridge Lookout. Numa is approximately 12 miles round trip with 2,930 feet of elevation gain in a less visited, wilder area of the park, the northwest corner. We begin our hike at colorful Bowman Lake, the third largest in the park, which offers quite a scenic backdrop. Passing through the forest, we\u2019ll begin our ascent up, looking for birds, bears, and other wildlife. The higher we climb, the more we\u2019ll notice the changing forest and wildflowers, and begin to see views of the lake. At the top is a fire lookout, built in 1933, with an incredible view of magnificent peaks and lakes in the distance.Firebrand Pass is 9.6 miles round-trip with a 2,200-foot elevation gain. This trail is located in the southern sector, one of the least traveled areas of the park. We\u2019ll begin our hike by crossing an open field into a forest of aspen and pine trees. As we ascend the trail through high vegetation with abundant wildflower color, we may break into song or chatter to avoid a surprise bear encounter. We\u2019ll continue our climb, leaving the tree line behind.

This classic alpine lake (Third Recess Lake) is forested on three sides and is ideal for swimming. In the past, the Third Recess Lake has provided some great fishing for those so inclined. We plan to camp here for two nights to provide more opportunities to further explore and enjoy the Mono Divide, solitude, or perhaps to create quiet space for yoga and meditation. With the setting of the sun and the rising moon, we may be treated with yet another iridescent alpenglow upon the peaks and the bright moonlight illuminating the basin. Total mileage is 6 miles with a 1,000-foot ascent and 1,300-foot descent.Day 8: Today we begin to make our way out of the John Muir Wilderness, first traveling back up Mono Creek and then continuing uphill to Trail Lake for our last night in the wilderness.

Forests cover the lower elevations and these slowly merge into tundra, which in turn rises to meet the snowcapped peaks and flowing glaciers of the Alaska Range. Congress established the park in 1917 to protect its abundance of large mammals, especially the Dall sheep. Originally named Mount McKinley National Park, it was renamed Denali NP in 1980 to honor Alaska\u2019s native people. \u00a0Denali, \"the High One,\" is the native Athabaskan name for this majestic mountain. \u00a0Also in 1980, the park expanded in size by four million acres as part of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act.Denali is unique among America\u2019s national parks because it gives ordinary visitors access to true wilderness -\u2013 with sweeping tundra vistas, breathtaking views of Denali, and abundant and diverse wildlife -\u2013 while remaining largely unspoiled. \u00a0Throughout the park it is common to see grizzly bears, caribou, Dall sheep, moose, foxes, and porcupines. \u00a0Less common, but still regularly sighted, are wolves and black bears. \u00a0The lucky visitor might glimpse a wolverine or a lynx. \u00a0Birdwatchers can keep an eye out for bald eagles, peregrine falcons, willow ptarmigan, and many other species; the summer avian population explodes with over 140 migrants joining the roughly 25 year-round species. The high glacial silt content in the rivers and lakes in the park do not provide for optimum trout or salmon habitat. \u00a0However, lake trout and grayling can be found in clear streams and lakes.The ProjectOur work project will be trail maintenance on one of the public trails in Denali. Our work will likely include building or repairing puncheons, boardwalks, water bars, and drainage structures as well as brushing and restoration. We also might be pressed into service to control invasive plants, which thrive in disturbed soil and are being spread by hikers. As with all service projects, flexibility is essential. As we get closer to the trip dates and park staff further prioritize their needs, a more exact project description will be provided to participants. We can look forward to a great project in a wonderful area.","highlights":"Enjoy a week in iconic Denali National Park, Join rewarding trail work for people at all levels, Watch for wildlife such as moose, caribou, and bears","includes":"  Hearty meals,   A full day to explore the park,   A ride on the Alaska Railroad from Denali to Anchorage","itinerary":"You should plan on arriving in Anchorage at least one day early to allow for flight and baggage delays as well as to do some exploring. Two days early is better. There will be a pre-trip meeting on Saturday in the late afternoon. This is a good opportunity to meet the other trip participants, go over some logistics, and solve any last-minute gear challenges (e.g. rain gear). \u00a0We\u2019ll also go to dinner together (no-host) that night.Day 1: We will depart early Sunday morning from Anchorage and travel by private van to Denali. This is about a seven-hour drive (with stops) full of beautiful scenery along the Parks Highway. We\u2019ll stop for rest breaks, lunch, and photo ops at several places along the way. Our knowledgeable driver will point out interesting sights on our journey and answer your questions. Along the way, we may catch a glimpse of Mt. Denali and maybe a moose or bear. When we arrive at the park, park staff will pick us up and take us to a group campground. The campsite has running water, toilet facilities, and bear-proof food storage, but no showers.\u00a0We will have time to set up tents and get oriented before our first group dinner. In the evening our liaison ranger will give us a briefing on our work project for the week--EXPANDFROMHERE--.Days 2-5: We will work alongside the trail crew and enjoy being among the flora and fauna of this magnificent park.

We will be able to ride the park bus anywhere from the farthest point on the park road all the way to the front-country. Our route, the only road in the park, parallels the Alaska Range and travels through low valleys and high mountain passes. Along the way, beautiful landscapes can be seen at every turn, and there may be opportunities to view Denali's peaks -- if the normally cloudy skies permit. \u00a0This bus ride through the park also provides the best opportunity to see abundant wildlife, although we can't guarantee it -- these are, after all, wild animals that follow their own schedule! \u00a0You\u2019ll have the freedom to step off the bus at any point to hike, take photos, or simply spend time relaxing in the heart of Denali before re-boarding a later shuttle bus.\u00a0If you aren\u2019t sure where you want to hike, your Sierra Club leaders and trail crew liaison will have plenty of ideas.Day 7: We\u2019ll break camp and take the world-famous Alaska Railroad back to Anchorage. \u00a0As we leave the park, the railway veers away from the road system and into the Hurricane backcountry area. \u00a0This region offers views of the snaking Indian River and the breathtaking sight of Hurricane Gulch from the top of a 296-foot bridge. \u00a0As we travel away from the park, we may have a last opportunity to get a view of Denali. \u00a0We will arrive in Anchorage in the evening.

Together, these three wilderness areas comprise the third largest wilderness area in the lower 48 states.On our adventure, we\u2019ll follow several beautiful river valleys; view jagged peaks, reefs, and vistas; and bask in the wilderness. Our main goal is the Prairie Point Lookout, where we\u2019ll be able to see the famous Chinese Wall, a 1,000-foot, 40-mile-long escarpment that is the result of an upheaval, creating a split from Glacier Park almost down to Yellowstone Park.

If we are lucky, we might see some of the area\u2019s wildlife, which includes wolverines, wolves, moose, deer, elk, mountain goats, mountain sheep, mountain lions, black bears, and grizzly bears.Originally protected as primitive areas in 1941, this wilderness complex was designated in 1964 as part of the original group of lands in the Wilderness Act. It was named to honor Bob Marshall, the co-founder of the Wilderness Society who worked tirelessly to protect and preserve primitive land in the lower 48 states as well as Alaska. He often took \u201cday hikes\u201d of 40 miles. Though we will figuratively walk in his footsteps: we won\u2019t try to match his mileage with our full packs.

Known as one of America's most ecologically diverse national parks, Olympic is a place where we can spy seals and whales off isolated offshore islands and sea stacks; surround ourselves with the overhanging fog, moss, and ferns of the temperate Hoh Rainforest; climb up to the alpine world of Seven Lakes Basin; and view Mount Olympus rising above a sea of peaks from the High Divide--EXPANDFROMHERE--. Olympic also harbors easily seen wildlife such as sea lions, orcas, and bald eagles at the coast; deer and Roosevelt elk in the rainforest; and a growing population of black bears and mountain goats in the high country. With 95 percent of Olympic National Park protected as wilderness, there's not a single road that crosses the park. So from our first step from the parking lot we enter a wild wilderness world.Combined in this single outing is a\u00a0six-day horseshoe-loop backpack through the eerie Hoh Rainforest and up to the Seven Lakes Basin, a layover day to explore the lakes, and a lofty traverse along the High Divide with commanding views of Mt.

By \u201cconceptual,\u201d we mean that there\u2019s no set path or trail to follow, only general guidelines and landmarks -- some key destinations linked together through a desire to stay as close to timberline as possible (timberline being that variable elevation where the trees thin out, a narrow band between forest and exposed granite).Such a route had been sought and achieved in small pieces, over decades of early trips into the high backcountry of the Sierra, but was first described cohesively by famed mountaineer and writer Steve Roper, in his 1982 work, \u201cTimberline Country, The Sierra High Route.\u201d\u00a0Our trip will start on trail at Road\u2019s End in Kings Canyon, moving up through Paradise Valley, before peeling away up Arrow Creek for a challenging cross country ascent of Arrow Pass to Bench Lake where we encounter a grand view of the Cirque Crest.

Hiking terrain will be loose, steep, and exposed in some sections, and there are several stream crossings that may require wading through cold water. It is intended for participants with previous backpacking experience at altitudes above 10,000 feet, although all well-conditioned backpackers are welcome to apply.","highlights":"Hike a rewarding cross-country route near Timberline, Spend two days in a remote high lake-filled basin, Enjoy spacious views of glaciated cirques and peaks","includes":"  Stories and lore from past Knapsack trips,   Healthy meals with organic and non-GMO ingredients,   Seasoned leadership, permits and pre-trip camping ","itinerary":"This trip starts on a Sunday and ends nine days later on a Monday.

On the first morning, we walk gradually up canyon, past Mist Falls, through Paradise Valley, to a campsite near the junction of Woods Creek and the South Fork of the Kings River at 6,600 feet.Day 2:\u00a0We\u2019ll cross a steel bridge, walk up Woods Creek a bit, and then turn to a cross-country ascent of an open slope, and cross a minor ridge to gain Arrow Creek. The path up Arrow Creek drainage is beautiful, and we\u2019ll camp near one of its upper lakes (10,500 feet).Day 3:\u00a0This day involves a crossing of Arrow Pass (11,600\u00a0feet). After an optional ascent of Arrow Peak, we descend to an exquisite campsite at Bench Lake (10,500\u00a0feet) with views across the lake as well as down canyon, with views of the fabled Muro Blanco.Day 4:\u00a0This will be a day filled with challenges and rewards. We begin by descending to the Kings River, crossing it, and then working our way up through slopes, lakes, meadows and open terrain to Cartridge Pass (11,800 feet). There is a very old trail there, the original route of the John Muir Trail; we\u2019ll use it where it\u2019s visible, but won\u2019t count on it always being there. Descending Cartridge Pass, we\u2019ll work to a suitable campsite for a layover in Lake Basin (10,600 feet).Day 5:\u00a0Today is a layover, with great opportunities for exploring Lake Basin. Fishing is good here, and there are more lakes than anyone can visit in a single day -\u2013 take that as a challenge!Day 6: Now on the \u201cformal\u201d Sierra High Route, we cross over to Marion Lake (10,300 feet), and then move over two minor passes, Red and Grey, finishing with a descent into lake-filled Cartridge Creek (10,200 feet).Day 7:\u00a0From Cartridge Creek, we embark on a thrilling section of cross-country hiking, where the route seems impossible and then opens to reveal the way. We cross Windy Pass, pass through State and Horseshoe Lakes, and then wander up Glacier Valley to our camp at Glacier Lakes (10,500 feet).Day 8: Today is all cross-country as we move from Glacier Lakes, crossing one minor and one major saddle. The going is easier here, and we finish at Grouse Lake (10,500 feet), which is renowned for having one of the best views in all the Sierra -\u2013 featuring evening sunset, morning sunrise, and a lake view spread out below. It\u2019s worth the effort of the entire trip to get here.Day 9: Our final day starts with a mile of easy and level cross-country, then a seven-mile plunge down 5,000 feet to the trailhead. The trail is extremely well graded, and the miles pass easily.The route as outlined above is tentative and may be modified due to unforeseen circumstances. Please bring a flexible demeanor and a good sense of humor, should we need to make any changes!

Whitney. Our route will wind northward along the western flank of the Sierra Crest beneath the two highest peaks in the Sierra Nevada: Mt. Williamson and Mt. Whitney. Along the way we will explore lake basins that lie at the foot of a multitude of peaks that tower over 13,000 and 14,000 feet. Perched high among these peaks at 12,800 feet is Lake Tulainyo, the highest lake in the Sierra Nevada, which we may choose to explore on a planned layover day. This is some of the highest, most rugged and spectacular country on the continent.The vast majority of visitors to this spectacular region are drawn to the summit of Mt. Whitney. We will avoid Whitney and, instead, explore the surrounding peaks and basins, an area of equally striking beauty without the overwhelming crowds of Mt. Whitney.We will travel lightly in a group of six participants, plus two leaders -- fewer than is typical for High Sierra trips. Most trips have 10 to 13 participants in addition to the leaders.Our trip follows a high and challenging route -- part off-trail and part on-trail -- that traverses the rugged alpine terrain immediately beneath the dramatic peaks of the Whitney Crest. From Miter Basin, we cross a rugged 12,600-foot cross-country pass to Crabtree Lakes Basin and continue northward to explore the Wallace Lakes and Wright Lakes basins. A highlight of our trip is two planned layover days, one in Miter Basin and one near Wallace Lake, which will provide excellent opportunities for climbing peaks, exploring peaceful secluded lakes, or relaxing in the exquisite beauty of the High Sierra.Nine days and 53 miles after we begin our adventure, we will follow a lightly used trail over Shepherd Pass and leave the alpine beauty of the High Sierra to descend steeply into the Owens Valley.Although we start and finish our trip on major trails, over a third of our mileage will be on cross-country routes or unmaintained trails. The off-trail hiking and scrambling is not technically difficult, but there will be enough challenging sections to add some adventure. Altogether our route includes two cross-country passes and two high trail passes. All camps, but one, will be above 11,000 feet.","highlights":"Hike a challenging cross-country route, Travel lightly in a small group, Explore or relax on two planned layover days","includes":"  Great meals for vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike,   Group cooking gear & equipment,   Pre-trip campsite and permit fees","itinerary":"Pre-Trip:\u00a0Campsites will be provided the night before our trip starts.\u00a0We will meet so that everyone can introduce themselves, talk about our trip, check weights of packs, and distribute some commissary\u00a0gear.\u00a0We will need to shuttle a few cars to the exit trailhead.\u00a0This will ensure a smoother start to our trip.Participants are encouraged to arrive a day or two early to start acclimatizing to the very high elevations we will encounter at the beginning of the trip. Giving your body an extra couple of days to adjust to the high elevation can often make a big difference between enjoying the trip, or merely just enduring it.Day 1:\u00a0Our trip officially begins at 7 a.m., when we will provide a group breakfast at our campsite. Starting at the Cottonwood Creek trailhead, we plan to\u00a0cover about seven miles and climb about 1,000 feet to camp near Long Lake.

We will climb 500 feet on this trail to the summit of Shepherd Pass. Although we will be on trail for the rest of the trip as we descend into the Owens Valley, the upper part of this trail is very steep and has very loose footing. We will be thankful we are heading down this rough trail rather than up. Our final night at Anvil Camp is 1,800 feet below Shepherd Pass, where we will enjoy fine views of the Owens Valley below.Day 9:\u00a0We hike down into the high desert. Our descent is rudely interrupted by a 500-foot climb, but mainly we just go down, down, down -- descending 4,400 feet in six miles to finish our trip at the Symmes Creek trailhead.Our hiking schedule is not rigid -- how far we get each day and where we camp depends on how we feel, the weather, and other factors outside our control. Likewise, our precise route has not been rigidly set since we will be hiking off-trail during sections of the trip. There may be portions of the route that were not scouted by the leaders before the trip -- some scouting will be required during the trip, and flexibility is important. The itinerary described here should be taken as a general plan, and the actual route and schedule may depart from it.","leader1":"Larry Hughes","leader2":"Mark Chang","leader3":""}},{"trip":{"title":"Cirques, Peaks, and Lakes of the Wind River Range, Wyoming","id":"18127A","dates":"Aug 11, 2018 to Aug 18, 2018","destination":"United States, Wyoming","type":"Backpack","group":"","difficulty":"4 (out of 5)","priceHigh":"1025","priceLow":"1025","image":{"src":"https:\/\/content.sierraclub.org\/outings\/sites\/content.sierraclub.org.outings\/files\/styles\/trip-teaser\/public\/trips\/main-images\/18127_main_MichaelJensen.jpg?itok=O0wuJh6j","alt":""},"path":"\/outings\/cirques-peaks-lakes-wind-river-range-wyoming#trip=18127A","overview":"The Trip\"Thousands of tired, nerve-shaken, over-civilized people are beginning to find out that going to the mountains is going home; that wildness is a necessity; and that mountain parks and reservations are useful not only as fountains of timber and irrigating rivers, but as fountains of life.\" -\u00a0John MuirSnowcapped granite peaks soaring into the sky; frothy cascades churning through steep canyons; golden tundra glowing in the late-evening light; cold, deep lakes full of trout; moose grazing; pikas scurrying -- all these sights and more make Wyoming\u2019s Wind River Range a favorite of backcountry enthusiasts.

You could spend months exploring this visually spectacular region, but in the time we have, we'll focus on some of the highlights. We will drive past the tourist magnet of Banff, but spend our time at Lake Louise, the Icefields Parkway, and Jasper. Out hikes explore diverse landscapes and ecosystems. Trip highlights include hikes in the Valley of the Ten Peaks with stops at tea houses above Lake Louise, and visits to Athabasca Falls and the Chateau at Lake Louise--EXPANDFROMHERE--.The Rocky Mountains achieve their most spectacular grandeur in the Canadian Rockies. In contrast to the Rocky Mountains in the U.S., the Canadian Rockies have a much wetter climate and thus many more glaciers and rivers. The effects of glaciation and relative geologic youth have created a landscape of jagged peaks, precipitous slopes, and broad U-shaped valleys. This combination has earned the Canadian Rockies the designation as a UNESCO World Heritage site:\"The seven parks of the Canadian Rockies form a striking mountain landscape. With rugged mountain peaks, ice fields and glaciers, alpine meadows, lakes, waterfalls, extensive karst cave systems, and deeply incised canyons, the Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks possess exceptional natural beauty.\" (UNESCO)While human presence in the Banff area has been traced back at least 10,000 years, the area was relatively inaccessible until the Canadian Pacific Railway built a transcontinental railway in the 1880s and, more importantly, two resort hotels, the Banff Springs Hotel and Chateau Lake Louise. Jasper, on the other hand, began as a fur-trading outpost. When the Jasper Forest Park was created in 1907, Jasper became its commercial services center. The completion of the Icefields Parkway between Lake Louise and Jasper opened a corridor linking Banff and Jasper national parks.","highlights":"Travel the Icefields Parkway, Hike among turquoise glacial lakes, Watch for elk, black bears, and other wildlife","includes":"  Hotel accommodations and all meals,   On-trip transportation and scheduled airport pick-ups,   Park admissions, fees, and tips, except on free day","itinerary":"Day 1:\u00a0We will gather at 4:00 p.m. at our hotel in Calgary, Alberta, for introductions and orientation before adjourning to our first dinner together.

Our adventure passes through glacier-carved valleys with dozens of crystal-clear lakes and countless snowmelt cascades and streams. Alpine forests, rolling green meadows accented with vibrant wildflowers, and extraordinary mountain views are the backdrop for this spectacular hike. Highlights of the trip will be hiking to the top of Squaretop Mountain, Knapsack Col, and Stroud and Glover peaks.The \"Winds\" are in western Wyoming, comprising a range running roughly northwest to southeast for approximately 100 miles. The Continental Divide follows the crest of the range and includes Gannett Peak, which, at 13,804 feet, is the highest peak in Wyoming. There are more than 40 other named peaks in excess of 13,000 feet. Two national forests, Bridger-Teton and Shoshone, along with Bridger and Fitzpatrick wilderness areas, encompass most of the mountain range.The Winds were occupied as early as 9,000 years ago as evidenced by Yuma points, knives, and scrapers. Later the Crow tribe lived around the Winds. Trappers seeking beaver were probably in the vicinity in the early 1800s. By the mid-1800s Captain Bonneville, John Fremont, Kit Carson, and Jim Bridger were some of the first frontier men to explore the Wind River Mountains. Fur trappers, traders from St. Louis, and Native Americans from the region met in the late summer at the famous Rendezvous, which was located in a nearby valley, principally to trade beaver pelts.The Winds are composed primarily of a granitic batholith, which is granite rock formed deep under the surface of the earth more than one billion years ago. Over hundreds of millions of years, rocks that were once covering this batholith eroded away. As the land continued to rise during the Laramide orogeny, further erosion occurred until all that remained were the granitic rocks. The ice ages, beginning 500,000 years ago, began carving the rocks into their present shapes. Within the Winds, numerous lakes and cirques, or circular valleys, were carved out of the rocks by glacial activity. As a result, the Bridger Wilderness contains more than 1,300 lakes, ranging in size from less than three acres to more than 200 acres, with an average size of about 10 acres. The streams and lakes are home to cutthroat trout, rainbow trout, brook trout, brown trout, Mackinaw trout (lake trout), and golden trout -- about 2.5 million of which were stocked by a local explorer Finis Mitchell and his wife during the Great Depression. The forests surrounding the lakes are dominated by lodgepole pine, whitebark pine, subalpine fir, and Engelmann spruce.Several major rivers have headwaters in the range. The Green and Big Sandy rivers drain southward from the west side, while the Wind River drains eastward through the Shoshone Basin. The Green is the largest fork of the Colorado River while the Wind River, after changing its name to the Bighorn River, is the largest fork of the Yellowstone River. The Snake River drains the northwest portion of the Winds from Triple Divide Peak and eventually pours into the Columbia River.The Winds are known to have a small Grizzly Bear population, primarily in the northernmost areas but they are expanding their range, and some have been found near Pinedale, Wyoming. Other mammals include the black bear, elk, moose, mule deer, pronghorn, bighorn sheep, and wolverine. Bald eagles, falcons, and hawks are just a few of the 300 species of birds known to inhabit the region.","highlights":"Hike on trails that offer endless mountain vistas, Explore areas with abundant glaciers and lakes, Enjoy a myriad of beautiful wildflowers","includes":"  All meals, snacks, and cooking gear,   Permits and backcountry guidance,   Camaraderie and adventure","itinerary":"Plan to meet (and stay overnight) at the Rivera Lodge in Pinedale, Wyoming at 4 p.m. on Friday (the day before the trip starts) for introductions and commissary and equipment distribution. It\u2019s a great time to review trip plans and the packing list, and answer last-minute questions.Day 1: On Saturday, we will meet at 7:00 a.m. in the Rivera Lodge parking lot before we caravan to Green River Lakes Campground where our trip begins and ends. The road to Green River Lakes is usually in good shape and is a combination of paved and gravel roads that are barely passable by an ordinary sedan. We begin at Green River Lakes, 7,961 feet, and hike along the Porcupine Trail, ascending to 9,400 feet. At day\u2019s end, we will have climbed 1,400 feet and hiked about eight to nine miles on good trail. Our first night\u2019s camp is along Porcupine Creek below Porcupine Pass.Day 2: On our second day we will continue up Porcupine Creek, over Porcupine Pass (10,720 feet), and down along Dodge Creek to the New Fork Trail turnoff (9,480 feet) and then ascend to Lozier Lakes at 10,590 feet. Today, we\u2019ll move from the forests and meadows to alpine country above tree line with some accompanying dramatic views. We will have hiked about six miles, ascending 2,400 feet and descending 1,200 feet, on good trails.Day 3: Our third day will be a layover day at Lozier Lake. Passing by several beautiful lakes we will day hike off-trail about three to four miles to the top of Squaretop Mountain at 11,652 feet for spectacular views of the surrounding valleys and peaks, including the Green River Lakes from where we started. If the weather is not good, we will delay our layover day until later in the trip, where we will have another chance to get to the summit of Squaretop.Day 4: On day four we will continue along the New Forks Trail toward Clark Lake, veering off-trail toward Glover Peak where we drop our packs at about 11,400 feet and hike to the top of Glover Peak (12,068 feet). Returning to our packs we will continue our off-trail journey intersecting with the Doubletop Mountain Trail and No Name Lakes (10,590 feet), where we\u2019ll camp. We will have hiked about three miles cross-country and three miles on good trail for a total of six miles today with packs. We will have ascended and descended 1,000 feet. Add another mile and 600 feet up and 600 feet back down to day hike to Glover Peak.Day 5: Today, we\u2019ll follow the Doubletop Mountain Trail to Summit Lake and pick up the Highline Trail, which follows beautiful Pine Creek. By the end of the morning we will reach Elbow Lake at 10,777 feet and continue on to Shannon Pass. The morning\u2019s journey is about five miles with 400 feet of descent and another 600 feet of ascent. In the afternoon we will hike to the top of Stroud Peak (12,198 feet), enjoying magnificent views all the way to the Tetons, if the sky is clear, and having a bird\u2019s-eye view of aquamarine Peak Lake. It is a three-mile, round-trip day hike with elevation gain of 1,300 feet to reach the top. We will then continue another 1.5 miles (with about 500 feet of descent and 200 feet of ascent) past Peak Lake and through Cube Rock Pass to lovely Dale Lake, where we will spend two nights.Day 6: This morning we will day hike up to Knapsack Col, our highest point on the trip, with a stop at a beautiful waterfall along the way for lunch. The meadows leading up to Knapsack Col are full of wildflowers. From Knapsack Col we have spectacular vistas of the Continental Divide and the upper reaches of Titcomb Basin. We will plan to return to our camp near Dale Lake by about 4 p.m. so we have some time to enjoy this beautiful setting. Our hike to Knapsack Col is seven miles round-trip with a 1,700-foot elevation gain and loss.\u00a0Day 7: Today we continue our hike mostly downhill into Trail Creek Park, where we join the Highline Trail and continue through Three Forks Park to Beaver Park (8,080 feet) and camp, arriving by early afternoon. From Beaver Park we will day hike up the steep, but beautifully scenic trail to Granite Lake at 9,247 feet for glorious views. We will have hiked about seven miles with packs, descending 2,500 feet and ascending 400 feet on good trails. The hike to Granite Lake will add about 1,500 feet of elevation over about three or four miles. If the weather on Day 3 was unfavorable, we will arrive in Beaver Park on Day 6 so we will have another chance on Day 7 to summit Squaretop.Day 8: On our last morning we will start early, watching the sunrise over the verdant Green River Valley and Squaretop Mountain as we hike back to our cars at 7,961 feet elevation. It is about nine miles along good trails to our starting point. We should arrive at our cars by about noon and then caravan back to Pinedale for a well-deserved celebratory lunch at a local cafe.Please note that the itinerary may have to be changed depending on weather, the strength of the group, campsite availability, and trail conditions.","leader1":"Barry Morenz","leader2":"Mark Holcomb","leader3":""}},{"trip":{"title":"20s and 30s Treasures of the Triple Divide Peak, Sequoia-Kings Canyon National Parks, California","id":"18155A","dates":"Aug 11, 2018 to Aug 18, 2018","destination":"United States, California","type":"Backpack","group":"","difficulty":"3 (out of 5)","priceHigh":"775","priceLow":"775","image":{"src":"https:\/\/content.sierraclub.org\/outings\/sites\/content.sierraclub.org.outings\/files\/styles\/trip-teaser\/public\/trips\/main-images\/18155_main_ThomasMeissner.jpg?itok=pHGgX02X","alt":"20s and 30s Treasures of the Triple Divide Peak, Sequoia-Kings Canyon National Parks, California"},"path":"\/outings\/20s-30s-treasures-triple-divide-peak-sequoia-kings-canyon-national-par#trip=18155A","overview":"The Young Adventurers Fund is offering adults 18-35 years old a full $300 off this trip.

Shimmering azure lakes, surrounded by 13,000- and 14,000-foot rugged granite peaks, introduce us to some of the most dramatic and scenic mountain terrain in the Sierra Nevada. Moderate backpacking distances and a full layover in Miter Basin will provide time to explore wildflower-laden alpine meadows, glacially sculpted lake basins, and forested river valleys, or to simply relax and enjoy the great outdoors. Our loop journey not only travels sections of the Pacific Crest Trail, but also gives a gentle introduction into travelling off the beaten path, cross-country, into the remote reaches of Miter Basin. As a bonus, we will explore the equally dramatic Cottonwood Lakes Basin toward the end of the trip. Beginner backpackers are welcome, with adequate preparation--EXPANDFROMHERE--.\u201cKeep close to Nature's heart... and break clear away, once in a while, and climb a mountain or spend a week in the woods. Wash your spirit clean.\u201d \u2013 John MuirOur objectives are to enjoy this iconic area of the Sierra Nevada and complete the trip safely as a group. Participants should come prepared to meet the variety of challenges that outdoor travel brings when exposed to high elevation, primitive camping, extreme weather changes, and sore feet from carrying heavy packs. As successful backpacking experiences require thorough planning and preparation, the leader will provide pre-trip correspondence and resources to help with backpacking gear selection and physical conditioning.\u00a0Group size is limited to six participants, plus two staff -- a small group to create minimum impact in this very special place.","highlights":"Explore Miter Basin\u2019s wild, rocky moonscape, Fish, hike, or relax on a planned layover day, Learn the joys of small group off-trail travel","includes":"  Great meals for vegetarians and non-vegetarians,   Cooking gear, food, and bear-resistant canisters,   All permits and pre-trip campsite fee","itinerary":"Day 1:\u00a0We will meet at our campsites in Horseshoe Meadow Campground (elevation 10,100 feet), about 20 miles by car from Lone Pine, CA. There will be dinner at 5:00 p.m., the official start of the trip. This will be a great time for us to meet our backpacking companions and relax over a meal together before beginning our adventure. We will also go over trip procedures, give ourselves one more night to acclimatize to the high elevation, and finish preparations for our journey.We encourage participants to arrive a day or two early to begin acclimatizing to the high elevations we will encounter during the trip. Giving the body an extra couple of days to adjust to the high elevation can often make a big difference between enjoying the trip or merely just enduring it.Day 2:\u00a0After distributing group gear and food, we will depart our campsites in Horseshoe Meadow, where our trip will begin and end. After introductions and an equipment check, we will distribute group gear, which will be around 15-17 pounds per person. The trailhead, at 10,100 feet, is one of the highest in the Sierra and our route takes us over Cottonwood Pass (11,160 feet). Although this is one of the least demanding paths over the Eastern Sierra Crest, reached by hiking only 4.8 miles on a well-maintained trail, this will not be an easy first day due to the high elevation and around 1,500 cumulative feet of elevation gain. We will be carrying our heaviest loads of the trip\u2014all our supplies for seven days\u2014so excellent pre-trip conditioning will be required to enjoy this first day of hiking.Expect the shade of cottonwoods and pines to give way to the openness of granite, creeks, and grasses, culminating with grand vistas of Big Whitney Meadow and Sequoia National Park as we crest Cottonwood Pass. Shortly thereafter we make camp at Chicken Spring Lake at 11,250 feet, where we can swim, fish, or soak our feet in the cool water.Day 3:\u00a0This is one of the two longest days of the trip, with eight miles of combined on- and off-trail hiking, with 1,500 feet of elevation gain and loss. From our camp, we will work our way down to Rock Creek, where we will begin the exciting three-mile off-trail portion up the Rock Creek drainage into Miter Basin, a desolate stark moonscape surrounded by towering jagged peaks and filled with abundant high alpine lakes. The Miter, an iconic unforgettable rock formation, will come into view and almost certainly bring awe. We will set up our camp for two nights in its shadow. The Major General, Mt. Pickering, and Mt. Langley, the southernmost 14,000-foot peak in the Sierra, and a half dozen \u201cminor\u201d 13,000-foot peaks also surround us.Day 4:\u00a0Depending on group interest, weather, and snow conditions, we may choose to day-hike up to Sky Blue Lake and Crabtree Pass, into the upper reaches of Miter Basin, scale a peak or perhaps do something less ambitious. However, none of these will be mandatory since relaxation is encouraged.Day 5:\u00a0Today we will descend to Lower Soldier Lake, at 10,800 feet, losing 600 feet over three cross-country miles. After setting up camp, we plan to hike to Erin Lake; however, goals will be tailored to the group. Relaxing in camp around the scenic lake might be the most reasonable choice since the next day is one of the trip\u2019s two longest days.Day 6:\u00a0Awakening early, we will leave Soldier Lake and head up to the top of New Army Pass, gaining 1,500 feet over three miles. Resting at the top of the pass will allow us time to take in the dramatic vistas of Sequoia & Kings Canyon National Parks toward the west and Cottonwood Lakes Basin toward the east, the second of the two basins of our trip. Alternatively, if conditions on (Old) Army Pass and the weather allow it, and the group would like to attempt to summit Mt. Langley, the southernmost 14er in California, we may choose that route. At over 14,000 feet, the 360-degree view from Mt. Langley contains five additional 14ers, including the two highest, Mount Whitney and Mount Williamson. Whichever way we choose, the descent of around 1,400 feet into the Cottonwood Lakes Basin to our last camp at Muir Lake will afford grand views of this wonderful basin.Day 7:\u00a0After a restful night at Muir Lake, we will eat our last meal together, pack up, and hike six miles on-trail, descending about 1,400 feet to our cars, and enjoying the shade of the Cottonwoods for which the basin is named. We should be back to Horseshoe Meadow by noon; however, it would be most prudent to leave a bit of extra time to get to your next destination, especially to an airport to catch a flight. We strongly recommend making flight reservations no earlier than the day after the trip ends. We will say goodbye or possibly consider a well-deserved meal in Lone Pine with goodbyes to follow.Our hiking schedule is not rigid. How far we get each day and where we camp depends on how we feel, the weather, and other factors outside of our control. Flexibility is important. The itinerary described here should be taken as a general plan, and the actual route and schedule may depart from this outline.","leader1":"John Plander","leader2":"Nancy Mathison","leader3":""}},{"trip":{"title":"The Magnificent Canadian Rockies, Alberta","id":"18128A","dates":"Aug 12, 2018 to Aug 18, 2018","destination":"Canada, Alberta","type":"Backpack","group":"","difficulty":"3 (out of 5)","priceHigh":"1195","priceLow":"1195","image":{"src":"https:\/\/content.sierraclub.org\/outings\/sites\/content.sierraclub.org.outings\/files\/styles\/trip-teaser\/public\/trips\/main-images\/18128_main_MelodyGross.jpg?itok=JQvvYN73","alt":"The Magnificent Canadian Rockies, Alberta"},"path":"\/outings\/national\/brochure\/magnificent-canadian-rockies-alberta-canada-0#trip=18128A","overview":"The TripOn the far westerly edge of Alberta are two obscure passes teetering on the Continental Divide.

If you\u2019ve never seen a high-mountain glacier sprawled between distant peaks, with its lateral and terminal moraines, then this is the trip for you.This area is home to Peter Lougheed Provincial Park and is located in the heart of Kananaskis Country (it sounds as it's spelled). K Country -- as the locals refer to it -- was established in 1977, as a space to provide Albertans with an additional recreation area and to help relieve the congestion in the national parks. This 10,000-acre parcel lays southwest of Calgary. It is bordered by Banff National Park to the north and British Columbia on the west. The Continental Divide also runs through this park, and this is where we will be spending the majority of our time. The ever-present jagged peaks, as well as numerous streams, lakes, and glaciers will be our constant distraction as we hike along some rough and sketchier trails. The Canadian Rockies has an amazingly lush environment. Wildflowers of all sizes and varieties cover the alpine meadows and miniature alpine plants dot the scree fields. The park is also home to a variety of wildlife, which includes mountain goats, deer, caribou, moose, black and grizzly bears, as well as numerous small animals and birds.

This area is the transition zone from the mountain-scapes of the Sierra to the rugged beauty of the Great Basin, with lush meadows, high alpine lakes, jagged peaks, expansive vistas, and desert scenery. This diversity once prompted John Muir to call it \u201ca country of wonderful contrasts.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0Our trip will center in the Bridgeport Valley of the Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest. Volcanic forces followed by glaciation were the prime forces shaping the region. Mother Nature has since used its magic to carve out the scenic beauty we see today. One salient feature is Mono Lake, formed only 760,000 years ago but part of a 5-million-year history of tectonics and volcanism--EXPANDFROMHERE--. Today, it is one of California\u2019s richest natural areas, with 14 different ecological zones, a thousand plant species, and some 400 mammals, reptiles, and birds. Most notably, it is the critical nesting habitat for two million migratory birds. We\u2019ll sample that awesome history and the more recent human influences.For centuries the Washoe and Paiute tribes wandered the valleys and slopes of the Sierra Nevada range, but it was not until 1826 that this area saw its first white man, legendary mountain man Jedediah Smith. In 1859 the eastern slope saw its first gold rush that led to large-scale mining and boomtowns such as the \u2018ghost town\u2019 of Bodie, a monument to the history of the Gold Rush. By the early 1900s, recreation and tourism took hold and the region is now known for its beautiful and rugged scenery, along with opportunities for outdoor activities throughout the year.From our group site near Twin Lakes we will explore this unusually rich ecosystem with daily hikes, informative speakers, and environmental perspectives.

Rainier also contains one of the world's largest glacier systems occurring on a single peak. \u00a0With 27 glaciers and 50 permanent snowfields, many that drape the mountain in curtains of ice, nine percent of the park's surface is covered with glacial ice. So be prepared for grand hikes and incredible scenery on this wilderness exploration.We will camp and concentrate our adventure in the northeast corner of the park in the Sunrise and White River areas.\u00a0Hikes through old-growth forest lead to sublime views of the mountain, the\u00a0Emmons Glacier, waterfalls flowing at full force, and lakes set in a sea of beargrass and wildflowers.\u00a0Throughout the trip we will identify wildflowers, talk about Mt. Rainier's geology, explain the importance of insects and small mammals, and show how the health of an ecosystem depends on interactions of everything within it.\u00a0Flexibility with our schedule allows us to choose our hikes depending on snow level and safety. We camp in the same campground throughout the trip for more time on the trails. Evenings will be spent learning the history of Mt. Rainier National Park and discussing its environmental threats as well as steps the park is taking to reduce trash and greenhouse gases. So release the inner explorer in you and come out to play in this natural wonderland.","highlights":"Enjoy close-up views of Mt.

These areas --\u00a0along with neighboring Wrangell-St. Elias and Kluane parks --\u00a0form a UNESCO World Heritage site that, with almost 38,000 square miles, is the largest protected wilderness ecosystem on earth. This is a place truly unspoiled by humankind's heavy hand. The Tatshenshini River is known for its spectacular scenery and wildlife, and many seasoned river-runners consider this to be one of the world's premier raft trips. If you can take only one expedition to Alaska in a lifetime, this is it.From its headwaters in Canada's Yukon Territory, the Tatshenshini River flows south through British Columbia's highest mountain range to its confluence with the Alsek River, which eventually enters the Pacific Ocean at Dry Bay on the Gulf of Alaska. We will be rafting about 140 miles of this rivershed. The waters of the Tatshenshini flow slate-gray with the silted melt waters of the surrounding glaciers and snowfields. Numerous side streams add to the flow until the braided \"Tat\" becomes a mile wide. In all of North America, only the Columbia River delivers more water to the Pacific Ocean.Here the air is crisp and clean, and the sky -- when it is clear -- is a brilliant blue. Late-summer wildflowers line the riverbanks, and the valleys are verdant green against a backdrop of rugged gray peaks cloaked in ice and snow. Icebergs can be seen and heard breaking off glacial faces into Alsek Lake near the end of the trip. Wildlife can be plentiful on this Alaskan adventure. Eagles soar overhead while shore birds scurry along the water's edge. We will have an excellent chance of seeing bear, beaver, moose, red fox, mountain goats, Dall sheep, and perhaps a wolf, wolverine, or lynx. As we hike and float through this beauty, there will be plenty of time for photography, drawing, or just relaxing and enjoying the views, the silence, and the solitude.Most Alaskan adventures require considerable experience, equipment, physical stamina, time, planning, and effort. Rafting, however, is perhaps the least strenuous -- some would say the safest and most comfortable -- way to gain access to the true Alaskan wilds. Exploring this region and floating the Tatshenshini and Alsek rivers is the perfect introduction to Alaska for wilderness lovers.\u00a0Like on all Alaska trips, weather can be highly variable from rain to sunshine.\"We rowed up its fjord and landed to make a slight examination of its frontal wall. The berg-producing portion, a mile and a half wide, was broken into an imposing array of jagged spires and pyramids, and flat-topped towers and battlements, many shades of blue from pale, shimmering, limpid tones in the crevasses and hollows to the most startling, chilling, almost shrieking vitriol blue on the plain mural spaces ... It seemed inconceivable that nature could have anything finer.\u2028\"\u00a0- Sierra Club founder John Muir, Travels in Alaska, 1875","highlights":"Raft from the Yukon to the Pacific, Explore spectacular glaciers & hike pristine wilderness, See wildlife: bears, moose, eagles, wolves, sheep","includes":"  Half-day float through AK Chilkat Bald Eagle Preserve,   Tour and presentations at an ancient Tlingit village,   Chartered bush plane flight from Dry Bay to Yakutat","itinerary":"This trip begins in Haines, Alaska, and ends in Yakutat, Alaska. You are responsible for securing transportation to Haines and from Yakutat. You will coordinate travel with the trip leader. All other transportation is provided and included in the trip price. The trip involves crossing into Canada, which requires an up-to-date passport.We highly recommend you arrive in Haines a day before the pre-trip meeting in case of inclement weather or problems with your flight itinerary.\u00a0 You can arrive in Haines midday via the Alaskan Marine Highway ferry from Juneau or fly to Haines from Juneau (ferry or air flight not included in the trip price). A taxi can provide a short ride to a hotel in Haines. Haines is the type of town many people picture when they imagine Alaska; nestled in the upper reaches of the Lynn Canal Fjord, in front of the Chilkat River Valley. The Chilkat Mountain Range rises behind the river, providing a dramatic backdrop to the picturesque town, with restored Fort Seward buildings decorating the hillside in the foreground. Hotel not included in trip price--EXPANDFROMHERE--.Pre-trip (mandatory):\u00a0You can arrive in Haines on the ferry at midday on Tuesday. After arrival by ferry, a short shuttle from the ferry terminal will be provided. Members have the afternoon to explore Haines, grab a meal, and make any last-minute equipment purchases before the 7:00 p.m. mandatory orientation meeting (details to come from the trip leader). A shared double-occupancy room at a downtown Haines hotel is included in the trip price.Day 1:\u00a0On Wednesday, after breakfast in Haines you will spend a half-day floating through the Southeast Alaska Bald Eagle Preserve past the confluence of the Chilkat, Kleheni, and Tsirku rivers. Created by the State of Alaska in 1982, the preserve was established to protect and perpetuate the world's largest concentration of bald eagles and their critical habitat. It also sustains and protects the natural salmon runs and allows for traditional uses. The Preserve consists of 48,000 acres of river bottom-land of the Chilkat, Kleheni, and Tsirku rivers. More than 80 eagle nests have been observed in the Eagle Preserve. Over 3,000 bald eagles have been counted within the preserve during the fall congregation. What brings the eagles are the five species of salmon that spawn in these and other nearby streams and tributaries. The combination of water and large amounts of food bring large concentrations of eagles and other wildlife into the Chilkat Valley.Nestled along the banks of the Chilkat River rests the ancient Tlingit village called Klukwan. The name Klukwan is taken from the Tlingit phrase \"Tlakw Aan,\" which literally means \"Eternal Village.\" Klukwan enjoys a multi-layered cultural history that is preserved through the Tlingit language, rituals, stories, oral histories, and subsistence activities practiced by the Chilkat Tlingits. According to recent artifact tests, Klukwan has been in existence for 10,000 years. Members will be amongst the first non-natives to enter the \u201cvillage that has always been\u201d and learn about Tlingit culture, enjoy presentations in their lodge and other out buildings, enjoy a salmon dinner (included in the price of the trip), then get transported back to Haines.We will learn about regional conservation challenges from Lynn Canal Conservation (LCC) headquartered in Haines. LCC played a key role in helping to establish protections for the land we will be traveling through. Southeast Alaska and British Columbia rely upon a healthy environment to provide jobs, subsistence foods, recreation, and quality of life. LCC has a long-term commitment not only to the health of fish and wildlife populations, but to regulations that promote clean water and stream protection for watersheds, which are important to commercial, sport, and subsistence salmon fisheries. Protecting fish habitat is an essential part of a healthy economic future for this pristine region. Hotel in Haines. The next day, we leave early for our put-in at Dalton Post, on the Tatshenshini River, in Yukon Territory.Days 2-10:\u00a0The Chilkat Guides bus will arrive at 8 a.m. on day two in front of our hotel. We\u2019ll enjoy coffee and\u00a0 a breakfast snack before departing early for our put-in at Dalton Post, Yukon Territory, 110 scenic miles from Haines. The highway to the put-in passes through the Bald Eagle Preserve before climbing out of the coastal valley, entering Canada, and climbing into the alpine region of Chilkat Pass. Wildflowers, jagged mountain peaks, and hanging glaciers set the scene here. Once we reach the put-in, the guides will load the rafts, explain the rules of the river and bear etiquette, and then we'll be underway!The first section of the river takes us through Tatshenshini Gorge. After six miles of Class III rapids, the land opens up and flattens out. The remainder of the river is generally Class II at normal water levels. We soon enter the Tatshenshini-Alsek Wilderness Park where, over the next several days, we will wind our way toward the beautiful Alsek and Noisy ranges. Thickly forested valleys provide the perfect habitat for a large population of moose. Soon the river reaches the Alsek Mountains, a towering range of ice-capped peaks that turns the river south. Here the river once again picks up speed. There are good short hikes in this area. Weather permitting, we will have spectacular views of the surrounding mountains. This is prime wildlife habitat; the beaches are often marked by the tracks of moose, bears, and wolves, and occasionally we may catch glimpses of the animals themselves.As the river braids out into an ever-widening valley, tributaries pour in, doubling the river's volume time and again as it cuts deeper into the mountain ranges. The broad, open deltas of the tributaries provide excellent locations to spot wildlife. High on the slopes above, beautiful white mountain goats and Dall sheep graze on the grassy knolls and rugged crags. As we float downstream, we will notice the mountains growing taller and the glaciers increasing in size and number. The confluence of the Tatshenshini and Alsek rivers is an awe-inspiring place. Here, four major valleys converge and the river becomes a giant rolling highway, braiding out across a wide valley. Our camp here will be near the Alaskan border, where we will enter Glacier Bay National Park.Farther downstream, the Alsek rounds a blind corner and reveals the massive Walker Glacier. In the past, this breathtaking glacier tumbled down, crystal-blue, to the river's edge. Now the glacier has receded, and we plan to make a short hike (about a mile) to explore this glacier for an afternoon. Only by wandering onto the glacier will we be able to truly appreciate how huge, powerful, and seemingly alive they really are.Back on the river again, we'll count more than 20 glaciers in a spectacular panorama, where the river quickly moves away from Walker Glacier, and the surrounding high peaks rise steeply from the banks to their heavily glaciated summits. This is literally \"Ice Age country,\" with dozens of large and small glaciers filling every vista around our rafts. We'll pass the immense Novatak Glacier and float toward Alsek Lake. Here we should see many species of birds, including bald eagles, semi-palmated plovers, spotted sandpipers, northern phalaropes, water pipits, and Canada geese.Near the end of the trip, we'll reach Alsek Lake, where the Alsek and Grand Plateau glaciers join at the river to form an eight-mile-wide ice face, arching around the beautiful lake and filling it with icebergs. Thunder rumbles across the lake at regular intervals as the glacier spawns another berg. This scene is just the foreground, though, to one of the world's most beautiful and stunning backdrops: the massive rise of 15,300-foot, ice-clad Mt. Fairweather. Weather permitting, we will spend a day rowing out onto the lake for a closer look at the massive icebergs. Our last camp on Alsek Lake will be the most spectacular yet. Here you will learn the meaning of the phrase \"scenic overload.\"Day 11:\u00a0We will leave Alsek Lake for the final leg of our float trip to the take-out near Dry Bay, just before the place where the mighty Alsek meets the ocean. From there we will board a small charter plane (flight included in the trip price) for the scenic trip to Yakutat, where we plan to connect with Alaska Airlines for the flight to Juneau (arriving in Juneau around 9 p.m.). The flight to Juneau is not included in the trip price.

Millions of salmon, returning to spawn in the mainland rivers, must converge to pass through the Strait. Groups of orcas (or killer whales) wait to hunt the salmon in the passages. Gray whales feed in the shallow bays, while humpback whales are found just offshore. Along the shore, black bears roam, feeding in the intertidal zone.

Lassen has a rich history that includes several Native American tribes, gold rush settlers, fur trappers, Civilian Conservation Corps workers, and geologic study of the active eruptions of Lassen Peak from 1914 to 1917. Additionally, the park has more than 700 flowering plant species and a wide variety of wildlife, offering an incredible range of sights, sounds, and recreation.The ProjectThe exact nature of our service work will not be determined until the park season begins in June and park personnel assess priorities after the snow melts.That being said, at the time of print, we have been told that there is a good chance we will be involved in invasive species removal and trail maintenance near Manzanita Lake, a beautiful lake where we will camp. This work could involve pruning, thinning, and removing invasive species and fallen trees as well as grading trails for ease of travel. This is strenuous work at altitudes of 3,000-6,000 feet, so you will need to be in good physical condition to fully enjoy and gain satisfaction from the project. Safety and appropriate use of hand-tools are essential. All participants will be encouraged to work at their own pace and capability to allow for the best possible experience during the week.","highlights":"Help with invasive species removal and trail repair, Car camp on the shores of spectacular Manzanita Lake, Visit hydrothermal features in this unique ecosystem","includes":"  All trip meals and camping fees,   Supervision and training for service activities,   A community of new friends to work and play with","itinerary":"Day 1:\u00a0We will meet at the Manzanita Lake Campground around 4:00 p.m. We\u2019ll begin with a group introduction, orientation meeting, and trip policies.

From a remote landing strip, we will hike in the rugged, scenic Wulik Peaks area, immediately adjacent to the Noatak Preserve. We will see all phases of the Arctic, from lush shrub tundra to wind-blasted mountain crests. In addition, we will be traveling during the height of the season for blueberries, cranberries, and cloudberries--EXPANDFROMHERE--.\u00a0The trip is timed to allow us to witness the tundra at the height of its fall colors. Although not as often mentioned in the travel literature as Alaska\u2019s mountains and wildlife, the autumn tundra spectacle rivals that of Vermont. The low cover of prostrate plants turns an amazing array of colors from pale yellow to brilliant crimson, offset by the colors of the berries that these plants bear. The dwarf birch giving its name to the shrub tundra ecosystem turns a shade of blazing orange that seems so bright it couldn\u2019t possibly be real. Couple these colors with the unique low-angle lighting of the fading arctic sun, and you have a photographer\u2019s dream.\u00a0The tundra berries will be ready for us when we arrive. The Wulik basin has provided an abundance of blueberries in the past for trips timed a week or two earlier. On this trip we will be late enough to find ripe cranberries (actually a close relative that is equivalent to the Swedish lingonberry) and cloudberries, too. There is hardly a backpacking meal that could not be improved with a side dish of freshly made cranberry sauce.\u00a0Another important attraction on this trip is likely to be the fishing. The Wulik River is typical of pristine Brooks Range streams -- its impossibly clear water, tinted slightly blue-green, flows over gravel bars and cascades through rock ledges. These clear streams provide spawning habitat for arctic char, one of Alaska's most prized and best-tasting fish. Arctic grayling, another legendary sport fish, will be there to entertain the fly-fishing enthusiast. There should be plenty of fishing opportunities for those interested, but non-fishers will also find plenty to do -- including savoring the catch.\u00a0Of course, there is more to Alaskan wildlife than fish and berries! Our entire route lies within the range of the Western Arctic caribou herd -- Alaska's largest herd at nearly 500,000 animals. Late August is at the tail end of the fall migration, but we should see at least some caribou. Other species are abundant, too, including grizzly bear, wolf, Dall sheep, and moose. We once had a musk ox visit our camp on the Wulik, and wolves can sometimes be heard in the evening.","highlights":"Hike scenic & rugged areas of the Brooks Range, Experience colorful tundra foliage in autumn lighting, Feast on sea-run arctic char and ripe tundra berries","includes":"  Round-trip charter flights from Kotzebue,   Hearty backpacking meals and snacks,   Group cooking gear and cooking shelter","itinerary":"The trip will begin and end in Kotzebue, Alaska, where we'll meet our bush pilot and be shuttled to an improved (by Alaskan standards) gravel strip at the foot of the Wulik Peaks.

The leaders have extensive hiking experience and our diaries from past trips describe the best campsites, berry patches, and fishing holes along the way. In the past, there were complaints about the fish being too large for our frying pans and the berries being too much of a distraction from the hiking routine.

Geologically they have strong contrasts, being composed of both dolomitic limestone and volcanic formations. The cultural heritage of the area also has contrasts; with Italian, Ladin, and Tyrolean influences. In fact, most villages and towns have three names, in Italian, German, and Ladin. The Ladins were in the region before the Romans came and were never totally absorbed. The thousands of years of occupation have left their mark on the land, an impact we will acquire firsthand knowledge of. \u00a0We will be hiking in three distinct areas: Schlern, the Sella group, and the Puez-Odle Natural Park. Our mountain huts are sited in dramatic locations at the foot of peaks or deep in remote valleys--EXPANDFROMHERE--. \u00a0Carrying only our day packs (taxis will transport our luggage when necessary), we\u2019ll be free to hike and enjoy the scenery and villages of this captivating and historical area. As a hut-to-hut trip, we can spend more time up high in the craggy mountains than on most day-hike trips. Our experiences here will be made extra special by the welcoming and friendly nature of the people of this relatively remote and beautiful region of Italy. \u00a0This is the second of a two-part adventure. This one, Part B, is a hut-to-hut adventure with moderate to strenuous hikes that have a few short, difficult sections. On most days we will carry everything we need with us, but that doesn't mean heavy packs. The huts provide beds, blankets, showers, and hot meals, so besides standard day hike gear we only need a sleep sheet and toiletries. Part A \u2013 The Good Life, for those wanting an easier itinerary, is hotel based.

Arrive early and you can go to the South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology (not included) and see its fascinating exhibit on\u00a0\u00d6tzi, the Iceman, whose 5,300-year-old frozen body was discovered not far from here in 1991. \u00a0We'll walk to a nearby restaurant for an orientation meeting and a traditional Tyrolean dinner--EXPANDFROMHERE--.\u00a0Day 2:\u00a0Taxis will take us to our trailhead in Alpe Siusi, the largest alp in Europe. We're dropped at the end of the road, surrounded by miles of rolling green meadows. From here we walk a short way to a small gully, cross the unique wooden bridge, and then proceed up the switchback trail to the top of Mount Schlern. We can look down at the town of Castelrotto below, and then turn east and hike to our first mountain hut (rifugio in Italian). At first the trail is along the ridgetop of the mountain, but after a while we go down into a rocky valley that nearly parallels the ridge. Finally the red roof of the rifugio springs into welcomed view. No access to luggage tonight. 7.5 miles; up 3,800 feet, down 2,000 feet.Day 3:\u00a0We continue our walk east, passing through a mix of alps and the rocky sides of mountains. Our start is easy, with open terrain on both sides as we contour along the long side of Sasso Piatto (Dish Rock). After a while we slowly work our way higher up the mountain until we finally top a small pass; in the saddle of which is our new rifugio. A high hill is on the right, and the steep slopes of Sasso Piatto are on the left. The rifugio has an excellent restaurant. Overnight in the rifugio. No access to luggage tonight. 7 miles; up 2,000 feet, down 2,500 feet.Day 4:\u00a0Taxis will pick us up and take us to Passo Pordoi where we get the lift up to the flank of Piz Boe, 10,250 feet. We start our hike crossing the open, rocky expanse on the shoulder of the peak, then make the short but steep ascent to the top. The steep last 200 feet involves crossing big boulders. There is a chain at places to provide the added comfort of a hand-hold for those who wish. Then we head down, at one point going down a very steep gully with loose footing for about 200 feet. Then the second half of the day is spent angling down the mountainside. To give our knees a rest, we take a gondola down for the last bit into Corvara. Here our luggage rejoins us as we enjoy the comforts of our four-star hotel. 4.5 miles; up 1,200 feet, down 3,500 feet.Day 5:\u00a0We take another taxi, winding up a narrow country road to our trailhead. Then we climb up a steep slope covered with scree. The footing is loose, but the reward is great as we emerge onto a lunar-like landscape of limestone paving stretching for miles in all directions. \u00a0We are now in the middle of the Puez-Odle Natural Park. This is a very empty stretch, so we'll almost certainly be alone as we walk the now gentler path through the open valley. We know we've reached our destination when we make a last steep but short descent to the rifugio. Overnight at the rifugio and no access to luggage. 5.5 miles; up 3,000 feet, down 1,800 feet.Day 6:\u00a0We return to the highway by a different and less steep route. Our start is crossing the shallow valley, looking for firm ground on the sometimes boggy soil. Then a half mile of steep but good trail takes us up to a plateau, which we then walk along. With ups and downs, eventually we come to the edge of the plateau and descend a steep, wooded trail back to the road. Meeting the taxi, which already has our luggage, we ride all the way back into Bolzano, arriving in time to check into our hotel, clean up, and enjoy a farewell dinner. 7 miles; up 1,100 feet, down 2,300 feet.Day 7:\u00a0The trip ends after breakfast.

Several boom towns (now ghost towns) thrived for the next 80 years until coal and native timber gave out. As coal diminished, people began to leave the area and the forest reclaimed many of the abandoned towns and mines. In 2015 our service project was centered around Nuttalburg, an abandoned coal town that Henry Ford once leased. It is now a historic site. In 2016 our service project centered around making hiking and mountain biking trails in the northern section of the New River Gorge.\u00a0In 2017, the trip was cancelled the week before the trip due to unforeseen circumstances by the WVA Dept. of Transportation fixing the bridge to Camp Brookside.\u00a0The New River Bridge is the longest steel arch bridge in the Western Hemisphere.\u00a0We will develop a sense of place and pride as we work with the National Park Service in the Gorge. The spirit of miners, lumberjacks, and railroad men will be with us as we help the Park Service preserve the area for a new heritage of high adventure and tourism. Each year, more than a million people visit the New River Gorge, seeking outdoor recreation -- rafting, hiking, rock climbing, camping, history, and much more. Even as we work to make the park more accessible and enjoyable for modern visitors, we will gain an understanding and reverence for those who lived in these towns and made New River Gorge a center of export for an industrial revolution. Their bones are felt in the mountains, their stamina in the trees, and their self-reliance in the streams.\u00a0The ProjectWe will work with the National Park Service to build and maintain trails or rehabilitate historic and cultural sites within the New River Gorge National River. As we help make the park a more welcoming place for today's visitors, we will learn about the natural and human history that shaped the region. Our work schedule will remain flexible as the Park Service may have other projects and priorities. We may drive 50 miles (one way) and spend up to two hours each day to get to worksites. Some commutes may include gravel roads and rough \"Jeep\" trails and have moderate hikes in order to reach remote areas.\u00a0Because of the strenuous nature of the work, the minimum age is 15 for this trip.","highlights":"Help maintain trails and restore historic sites, See the Western Hemisphere's longest steel arch bridge, Raft the exciting Lower New River","includes":"  All meals (except one dinner),   All group gear,   Full day of guided whitewater rafting ","itinerary":"Day 1: We will meet at Camp Brookside, located about five miles from the Sandstone Visitor Center, at 6:00 p.m. for dinner.

The city center has two distinct parts: New Town to the north has Princes Street and the main shopping street, and Old Town to the south and east of castle ridge is brimming with history among the atmospheric, medieval cobbled streets and alleys--EXPANDFROMHERE--.\u00a0After breakfast, we will walk along the Royal Mile to Hollyrood Park, marveling at the various buildings that define the city\u2019s history. We will then hike up to Arthur\u2019s Seat, elevation 800 feet, which is one of the seven hills that loom over the city. We will enjoy a picnic lunch here (which will be on your own), then hike back and visit the Palace of Holyroodhouse, Her Majesty the Queen's official residence in Scotland; we can view the Royal Apartments, which reflect the changing tastes of monarchs over the years. Overnight in hotel.Day 3:\u00a0Take a minibus to Loch Lomond-Trossachs National Park, where we\u2019ll intersect the West Highland Way, one of the world\u2019s most famous long-distance treks. Its total distance is 96 miles, but we\u2019ll be content with the leg from Drymen to Balmaha (8 miles\/1,200 feet) for sweeping views of Loch Lomond and the Isle of Arran. Here we\u2019ll truly pass into the Highlands, walking along the Great Highland Fault, which marks the geological transition between the Lowlands and the Highlands. We will make a stop by a stream to enjoy a packed lunch (on your own). Overnight by Loch Lomond.Day 4:\u00a0Transport to Rannoch Moor for coffee, then meet once again with the West Highland Way for a moderate climb up the Devil\u2019s Staircase and then down to the town of Kinlochleven (8 miles\/1,300 feet). The Devil\u2019s Staircase is a prominent hillside trail named in the mid-1700s during Scotland\u2019s major road building program. Our destination is the area known as Glencoe, renowned for awesome scenery and savage history (the Glencoe Massacre of 1692). A packed lunch is included. Overnight in Alltshellach.Day 5:\u00a0We'll explore\u00a0the valley of Glencoe, one of the most spectacular and haunting places in Scotland. The glen was initially formed by an ancient super-volcano, then shaped by an ice-age glacier. The resulting stark mountain walls enhance the grim beauty of the narrow glen, less than a half-mile wide. Dominating the classic entrance to the valley is the distinctive conical mountain called the Pap of Glencoe; at 2,400 feet directly above the River Coe, a walk along the mountain slopes provides even more striking views of the glen and nearby Loch Leven. A packed lunch is included. Overnight Alltshellach.Day 6:\u00a0Ferry to Isle of Lismore, a fertile, low-lying island that was once a major center of Celtic Christianity; on it are the ruins of two 13th-century castles, a 6th-century monastery, and an Iron Age hollow-walled structure called a broch, of a type found only in Scotland. Our day-long walk starts at the picturesque, old fishing village of Port Ramsay. We will stop for a packed lunch along the shores of Loch Baile a'Ghobhlainn. Returning to the western shores, we\u2019ll visit the Island Heritage Centre and the ruins of Castle Coeffin, then follow a low ridge to the island\u2019s highest point and return to the ferry via Port Ramsay (8 miles, 700 feet). A packed lunch is included. Overnight Alltshellach.Day 7:\u00a0Visit the iconic Eilean Donan Castle, one of the most visited attractions in the Highlands. Still owned by Clan MacRae, it has been destroyed and rebuilt numerous times throughout its history. Most recently, it's been the location for many Hollywood movies. The original castle was built in the early 13th century as a defense against the Vikings. We'll take time here to discuss the history and future of Scotland's salmon fisheries. A packed lunch is included, after which we will transfer to Lochalsh Woodland for a walk with a ranger from the Balmacara Estate. Our stay for two nights is an award-winning hotel situated in the picturesque settlement of Plockton on the shores of Loch Carron, yet another wonderfully scenic area of the Highlands.Day 8:\u00a0Travel to the Isle of Skye, Scotland\u2019s largest island,\u00a0and walk the famous Quiraing. Located in the north of Skye, this walk features fascinating geological oddities as well as stupendous views. Part of the Trotternish ridge, it has been formed by a massive landslip. We'll watch our step on the steeper parts of the path while admiring the cliffs and pinnacles of rocks around us.\u00a0 On a clear day, the Outer Hebrides fill the horizon.\u00a0 If it is wet and windy, the clouds and mist swirl around the rocks, creating a mysterious and magical experience.\u00a0Though often cloudy (sky-a\u00a0is old\u00a0Norse for 'cloud island') any rain showers are more than made up for by the spectacular scenery.\u00a0We will enjoy a packed lunch, on our own, during the hike. Return to our hotel in Plockton for a second night.Day 9:\u00a0On to Loch Ness, the second-largest inland lake in Scotland (after Loch Lomond); due to its great depth, it is actually the largest by volume. Overlooking Loch Ness is Urquhart Castle, a dramatic ruin with a long and bloody history. The present ruins date\u00a0from the 13th to the 16th\u00a0centuries and were built on the site of an earlier medieval fortification. Once one of Scotland\u2019s mightiest strongholds, Urquhart\u2019s strategic location gave it a key role in the Scottish battle for independence. For an even grander view of Loch Ness, we\u2019ll walk a section of the Great Glen Way (8 miles\/1,000 feet) along splendid forest trails and look eagerly down into the dark waters of the Loch for Nessie, one of the most elusive, celebrated creatures of modern times. Lunch will be on our own. Overnight in the small, Victorian village of Pitlochry.Day 10:\u00a0Our highlights\u00a0today include a tour of the\u00a0internationally renowned Dewars Distillery, a walk in Aberfeldy (where we will stop for lunch, on our own), and a visit to\u00a0Stirling Castle, one of the largest and most important castles, both historically and architecturally, in Scotland. Many of the principal buildings date from the 15th and 16th centuries. Dominating the skyline for miles around, it is probably the grandest castle in Scotland and a formidable symbol of Scottish independence. Great Scottish figures such as William Wallace, Robert the Bruce, and Mary Queen of Scots have all been associated with the castle. We\u2019ll also visit the Church of the Holy Rude, the second-oldest building in Stirling after the castle; founded in 1129, the parish church was the location for the coronation of King James VI in 1597. Overnight in Edinburgh.Day 11:\u00a0Return flights to the U.S. or continue this marvelous adventure in the United Kingdom.","leader1":"Pritpal Singh Kochhar","leader2":"","leader3":""}},{"trip":{"title":"Wilderness Backpacking in Stein Valley Nlaka'pamux Heritage Park, British Columbia","id":"18113A","dates":"Aug 26, 2018 to Sep 2, 2018","destination":"Canada, British Columbia","type":"Backpack","group":"","difficulty":"5 (out of 5)","priceHigh":"1195","priceLow":"1195","image":{"src":"https:\/\/content.sierraclub.org\/outings\/sites\/content.sierraclub.org.outings\/files\/styles\/trip-teaser\/public\/trips\/main-images\/17114_2_Alamy.jpg?itok=YAkvejlz","alt":"Stein Valley Nlaka'pamux Heritage Park, British Columbia"},"path":"\/outings\/backpack-stein-valley-british-columbia#trip=18113A","overview":"The TripThe Stein Valley\u2019s name is derived from the Nlaka'pamux word \"stagyn,\u201d which translates to \u201chidden place.\" Throughout our eight-day full traverse of the valley, we will be guests in this sacred land and experience some of the hidden secrets the Stein has held onto for thousands of years.

We will cover some important safety topics, have a question-and-answer period, as well as relay other essential information for our upcoming adventure. Group cooking gear and food will be distributed and plans for the following day will be set. Expect the meeting to last approximately one hour.Day 1: [Trailhead to Riverside Camp] Our group van departs from the leader's hotel at 7:00 a.m. for a three-hour drive. We arrive near Lytton trailhead where we meet with a representative of the Lytton First Nations, who will spend 45 minutes describing the cultural significance and history of the Stein Valley. After that, we begin our hike in the lower valley, making our first stop at the sacred Asking Rock to view the pictograph and participate in the ancient tradition of asking for \u2018safe passage\u2019 throughout the valley. Our first day consists of relatively easy hiking on well-marked trail. \u00a0As we make our way along the Stein River we pause to take in the impressive landscape of steep canyon walls, ponderosa pine, and towering Douglas firs. We cross a suspension bridge with the roaring Stein underneath and set up camp at Riverside Camp. (Distance hiked: 8.7 miles. Approximate elevation gain of 1,500 feet, elevation loss of 525 feet.)Day 2: [Riverside Camp to Cottonwood Creek Camp] Views of Evenglow Mountain in the distance guide us this day. We will stops at several scenic viewpoints in the lower canyon, including Cottonwood Falls. Beaver ponds, wetland, aspen, willow, firs, and plentiful birdlife are present in this area. The trail continues to be well defined, with the occasional deadfall debris that must be crossed. We set up camp at Cottonwood Creek. (Distance hiked: 10 miles. Approximate elevation gain of 1,800 feet, elevation loss of 900 feet.)Day 3: [Cottonwood Creek Camp to High View] This section of the trail provides variety in terrain and scenic views of the upper canyon. If there has been a recent forest fire, part of the trail may be covered with scrub brush, which could create some fun navigational challenges. We set up camp at High View Camp for the night. (Distance hiked: 10 miles. Approximate elevation gain of 1,800 feet, elevation loss of 900 feet.)Day 4: [High View to Stein Lake] Today we begin to make our way to our first of several stunning lakes while passing through enchanting cedar-hemlock forests. During the day, we cross streams using all kinds of methods such as wading, logs, and one-person cable cars. We arrive at Stein Lake for a well-deserved night's rest. (Distance hiked: 8 miles. Approximate elevation gain of 1,700 feet, elevation loss of 1,200 feet.)Day 5: [Stein Lake to Tundra Lake] Today is the most intense day as we make our way to the alpine. As we climb, we are rewarded with breathtaking views during a ridgewalk, where we can see the lower valley from where we ascended. Rapidly changing weather is the norm in this environment so we take care to maintain several layers of clothing and adjust as the conditions require. Camp is made at Tundra Lake, a beautiful cobalt blue, alpine lake. (Distance hiked: 6.5 miles. Approximate elevation change 4,700 feet, of which 3,200 is elevation gain.)Day 6: [Tundra Lake to Caltha Lake] The distance we travel today is short, but we will take our time as we carefully cross several large boulder fields. Crossing the boulders will give our legs a workout; our lovely surroundings, including the colorful Tundra Lake, will give our eyes a workout. Inclement weather can sometimes add to the challenge of this segment. Camp is made at Caltha Lake and if we have extra energy, we can explore a couple of peaks in the area. (Distance hiked: 1.3 miles. Approximate elevation loss of 350 feet.)Day 7: [Caltha Lake to Lizzie Cabin] Today, we spend the last hours of our trip in the alpine region and then descend into the subalpine. We stop for the night at the backcountry Lizzie Cabin, which is open to the public. The cabin is a comforting sight after 7 days of backpacking. We may warm ourselves by the wood fireplace, dry some clothes if we met with inclement weather, or just relax in this historic cabin. For the evening, some may choose to sleep in the cabin and some may prefer to sleep in their familiar tent homes under the sky. (Distance hiked: 4.5 miles. Approximate elevation gain of 1,300 feet, elevation loss of 2,000 feet.)Day 8: [Lizzie Cabin to Trail Exit] On our last day, we will experience much like we have for the week: boulder fields, stream crossings, enormous Douglas fir, and views of distant lakes and mountains. A little after noon, we should arrive at the maintained Lilloet Forest Service Road, where our group van will be waiting to transport us back to Vancouver Airport with an ETA of 5:00 p.m. Even though the hiking adventure will be over, we will be treated to incredible views on the drive down the famous Sea-to-Sky Highway, which is often regarded as one of the world\u2019s most scenic drives.

Dinner will be an\u00a0espicha, the traditional eating party that celebrates the opening of the cider barrel.Day 5:\u00a0We'll walk the west side of the Picos today, our circular route taking us to the heart of the Picos de Europa National Park. We'll visit the Lakes of Covadonga, and the Covadonga Sanctuary, a place of pilgrimage for the people of Asturias, where the \"reconquest\" of Spain began. We may meet some of the local shepherds who make Gamoneu, the world's most expensive cheese. We'll also learn more about the Bearded Vulture Conservation Project and the challenges of balancing the human uses of the National Park with the needs of wild animals, such as wolves. (8 miles, +1,000 feet, -1,000 feet) We'll have our dinner at a restaurant where local chefs promote the use of heirloom livestock to help return the area to a more sustainable local food system, following the concepts of the European Slow Food movement.Day 6:\u00a0Today we focus on the extensive and fascinating human history of the \"Kingdom of Asturias.\u201d Traveling in our bus along the unspoiled coast of Asturias, we may have time to visit one of the lovely beaches or fishing villages, among the most traditional in Spain. We will have lunch on our own in the historical Asturian capital of Oviedo and then continue our journey, watching the character of the landscape and villages change as we reach Spain's westernmost province, Galicia. Dinner will be at our hotel near the town of Ribadeo, our home for the next two nights.Day 7:\u00a0Today\u2019s walk is along ancient paths between abandoned hamlets and villages where we\u2019ll find a rural way of life that has almost died out in Europe. The countryside is dotted with\u00a0horreos, traditional granaries, and ancient\u00a0cortines, circular enclosures made of high stone walls built to protect beehives from the local brown bears\u2019 sweet tooth. The black slate roofs of the traditional buildings contrast beautifully with the fertile fields of \"Green Galicia.\" (12 miles, +\/- 2,000 feet) Dinner will be at our hotel outside Ribadeo.Day 8:\u00a0Today we drive southwest a couple of hours toward central Galicia, land of forest and mist. We visit Lugo, with its Roman walls -- considered the best-preserved in the world -- before continuing our journey to our next inn, a 16th-century water mill inside a Biosphere Reserve, which will be our home for the next two nights. Spend the afternoon getting settled, or enjoy a walk on your own along a tree-shaded river within the reserve. Lunch and dinner will be at our inn.Day 9:\u00a0Today we walk a beautiful section of the Camino Frances, the main stem of the Camino de Santiago, from Tricastela toward the village of Sarria. Tricastela was one of the quarries for the stone used in the cathedral in Santiago. Pilgrims used to carry as much stone as they could to the kilns in Castaneda, over 100 kilometers away! (Distance: 9 miles +800 feet, -1,200 feet) We'll have our lunch in a village along the Camino, and then drive to O\u2019Cebreiro, the point at which \"The Way of St. James\" crosses the mountains into Galicia. In O'Cebreiro we\u2019ll see the\u00a0pallozas, round stone houses with a straw roof, which were inhabited until relatively recently. We'll also visit a pre-Romanesque church, the oldest remaining fully intact on the Camino, to see its mysterious Holy Grail. Our dinner will be at our inn within the Biosphere reserve.Day 10:\u00a0Today we walk the Camino Frances from the village of Sarria to the village of Fereiros, through woodlands, valleys, and green countryside. (7.5 miles, +700 feet) Lunch will be either an outdoor picnic or\u00a0menu del dia\u00a0in a restaurant along the Camino. We then travel two hours in our bus to the end of our pilgrims' trail, the glorious city of Santiago de Compostela. We\u2019ll have the rest of the afternoon on our own to explore the city. Visit the famous cathedral, enjoy the museums and shops, or just take in the atmosphere in the Plaza del Obradoiro, where pilgrims finish their long journey. Dinner is on our own tonight to allow more time to enjoy this lovely city. A hotel near the\u00a0Centro Storico\u00a0(historical city center) will be our home for the next two nights.Day 11:\u00a0From Santiago we drive about two hours to the Costa do Morte on the far-western edge of the European continent, a place of shipwrecks and superstitions. In pre-Christian times, this \"Death Coast\" was believed to be the gateway to the afterlife, and is dotted with dramatic rocky cliffs and unspoiled fishing villages. We\u2019ll have lunch on our own and free time to explore one of those villages. You may want to try some of the excellent local seafood. We return to our hotel in Santiago to pack and to enjoy a farewell dinner together as we say goodbye to our friends who have traveled The Way with us.Day 12:\u00a0Our trip ends today after breakfast at our hotel in Santiago de Compostela. You may want to plan a few extra days to enjoy this lovely city and the surrounding area.","leader1":"Nancy Mathison","leader2":"","leader3":""}},{"trip":{"title":"Rafting and Backpacking the Talkeetna River, Alaska","id":"18015A","dates":"Aug 30, 2018 to Sep 5, 2018","destination":"United States, Alaska","type":"Backpack, Raft","group":"","difficulty":"3 (out of 5)","priceHigh":"3095","priceLow":"3095","image":{"src":"https:\/\/content.sierraclub.org\/outings\/sites\/content.sierraclub.org.outings\/files\/styles\/trip-teaser\/public\/trips\/main-images\/Talkeetna-7_DennisTeutschel_0.jpg?itok=J7VCRL7a","alt":"Rafting and Backpacking the Talkeetna River, Alaska"},"path":"\/outings\/rafting-backpacking-talkeetna-river-alaska#trip=18015A","overview":"The TripThis trip takes full advantage of all the magnificence of the Talkeetna Mountains. Early departure provides exceptional viewing of Mount Denali as our bush plane rises above the mist, heading north and east. Our destination is a remote lake, deep in the Talkeetna Mountains. By mid-day we begin our backpack trek, gradually descending to the confluence of the Talkeetna River and Aspen Creek.The Talkeetna Mountains (Dghelaay tahwt\u2019aene in Ahtna), loosely translated\u00a0means\u00a0\u201cLand of Plenty.\" Consisting of a compact group of radial ridges, the mountains occupy a rugged oval area about 100 miles from north to south and 70 miles from east to west. High sharp-crested ridges in the east give way in the western flank to rounded and subdued ridgetops shaped by glaciers during the Pleistocene Epoch (about 2,600,000 to 11,700 years ago). Glaciers are still present at the heads of many valleys in the Talkeetnas--EXPANDFROMHERE--. The mountains are home to many large mammals, including grizzly\/brown bears, black bears, moose, caribou, wolves, wolverines, and Dall sheep. Wolves and bald eagles\u2014as well as smaller mammals and birds like beaver, porcupine, red squirrels, and fox sparrows\u2014call the surrounding area their home. Three days later, with Talkeetna Glacier, the headwater to the Talkeetna River, in the distance, we meet up with our rafting crew, ready to begin the rafting leg of our journey.The Talkeetna River is reputedly Alaska's premier whitewater wilderness trip. Of its 70 miles, 17 are continuous Class III-IV rapids through narrow Talkeetna Canyon. With closed-in canyon walls, lush trees, graceful ferns, paper birch, alder thickets, and fascinating driftwood sculptures lining the braided riverbed it is easy to see why the river is called Talkeetna the \"river of plenty.\" The river opens to valleys that host one of the largest grizzly and black bear populations of Alaska's interior rivers. Clear side streams entering the river make natural resting places for spawning salmon. Every summer, these salmon run up the river by the thousands, choking its tributaries and, in the course, becoming a feeding ground for bears, bald eagles\u2014and anglers. Silver salmon runs occur in late July through early August. Dolly Varden, Arctic Grayling, and catch-and-release Rainbow Trout also add to the potential catch. As we make our way down river, we'll have time for fishing, photography, day-hiking, or just relaxing in camp.On the last day, we will load our rafts one more time for our float back to the town of Talkeetna. The river broadens as we take in a north and west viewscape of Denali. Once back in town the trip ends, and folks collect their gear waiting for them at the airport, check into a room, and clean up. Hopefully we will meet once more, fresh and clean, for a last night\/first reunion meal, celebrating friendship and wilderness, before departing the next morning.","highlights":"Enjoy a premier Alaska wilderness rafting experience, Savor opportunities to view wildlife, hike & fish, Join other like-minded photographers, families & adults","includes":"  Views of Denali and glaciers and forested wilderness,   All rafting gear,   Meals","itinerary":"Pre-trip:\u00a0Once checked into your hotel, you will have an opportunity to take in the colorful community of Talkeetna, regarded as the classic model for the TV series \u201cNorthern Exposure.\" The evening prior to the trip departure, we will have a mandatory orientation meeting.

As these lucid descriptions were met with skepticism by Eastern newspaper editors, they were replaced by whimsical tales of petrified birds in flight, fish in a cold water spring swimming to the surface of hot water and being cooked, \"a lake with millions of beaver nearly impossible to kill because of their superior cuteness,\" and \"a canyon so deep that a man could shout into it at night and be awakened by his echo the next morning.\" Sensing truth behind the myth, future expeditions led to an eventual petition to the United States Congress to set aside this area of profound beauty and natural wonder--EXPANDFROMHERE--.

It sits on a geothermal hotspot that provides the heat necessary to drive the phenomenal hydrothermal features and volcanic activity in the park. Yet, according to local lore, although Yellowstone has over 1,000 miles of hiking trail, the majority of the Park\u2019s visitors do not leave the roadside to view its colorful splendor, wildlife, and hidden secrets.In partnership with the Yellowstone Forever, our on-trail week in the Park will provide educational opportunities.

We\u2019ll start our hike through an open area which will eventually lead us through a forest and to the shore of a thermal, emerald colored lake. A short distance from the lake are more thermal features to include steaming vents and boiling mud. Back into the forest and up the trail, we will emerge to an incredible artist\u2019s palette of colors on the canyon walls with the Yellowstone River far below. We\u2019ll continue to our lunch spot, guarding our food from inquisitive ground squirrels, while taking in the vast beauty surrounding us. We will be treated to closer views of the river and well photographed falls as we complete our loop.Day 7:\u00a0Observation Peak (9.4 miles, in\/out trail, elevation gain 1,400 feet)We\u2019ll begin our hike downhill into a forest of lodgepole pine until we eventually break out onto a fairly more level, rolling trail that passes large meadows with scattered stands of trees.\u00a0 After we reach the pristine Cascade Lake, we\u2019ll pause to look for trumpeter swans, moose, and bison.\u00a0 Beginning our ascent, we\u2019ll pass by a spruce and fir forest, again breaking out into open areas that were impacted by the 1988 fire.\u00a0 As we continue to climb, gaining better views, we\u2019ll listen for bugling elk in the forest below.\u00a0 At the top by the old lookout, our effort will be rewarded with distant views of Yellowstone\u2019s Grand Canyon, Mt.

And the best feature is that Mount Kilimanjaro is a broad shield volcano, which requires no technical skills to climb -- just excellent conditioning and an excitement for remote, exotic locations. Its famous snow cap is visible from over a hundred miles away, but climate change is quickly shrinking Kilimanjaro's glaciers; experts believe the snows will be gone within just a few decades. Take advantage of this fabulous opportunity to summit this legendary mountain while you hike with only a day pack! The local staff of cooks, porters, and guides carry our gear, cook the meals, and set up and take down our tents, leaving you free to contemplate and enjoy this magical place--EXPANDFROMHERE--.Our local guides have extensive training and experience in getting people acclimatized. They will escort us for eight days along the Lemosho Route, preferred because of its low traffic, high summit success rate, and beautiful scenery. We\u2019ll pass through four distinct climate zones: beginning at 6,500 feet in lush rain forest, we\u2019ll quickly pass into the giant heather and moorlands zone with its sparse vegetation of giant senecio trees and lobelia plants. Climbing higher into alpine desert, we\u2019ll marvel at the colossal boulders, dry, barren expanses, and scant plant life. And finally as we approach the summit, there is the frigid beauty of disappearing glaciers shimmering in the early rays of sunrise in the arctic zone. From there, you will reach the awe-inspiring Uhuru Peak and the \u201croof of Africa.\u201d A rapid descent on the last day and a half gets us back in time for a swim at the hotel before preparing for the safari, the perfect way to decompress from the hard trek up Kilimanjaro.A quarter of Tanzania's land is set aside in national parks and preserves. Surrounding Kilimanjaro are a series of national parks that contain some of the densest concentrations of wild animals in Africa. Swapping trekking for safari clothes, we\u2019ll drive through Tarangire National Park with its herds of wildebeest, zebra, elephant, and giraffe thriving along its permanent river. Then we\u2019re off to Tanzania's lush, subtropical Serengeti plains to ride open-topped Land Cruisers and spot and photograph thousands of wildebeest, zebras, and gazelles, and their accompanying predators. After a full day in the Serengeti, we move on to Ngorongoro Crater to marvel at black rhino, lion, leopard, cheetah, and various antelope. Finally, there is Lake Manyara National Park with its famous tree-climbing lions, flashy lakeside flamingoes, and variety of entertaining monkeys.It will be difficult to know whether to photograph the baboon's playful antics, or watch through binoculars as lions and hyena devour a kill, or list all the species we'll be seeing -- often at the same time! We will spend each night in \"wild camps,\" which have spacious tents with beds and en-suite facilities where we can hear the sounds of the bush and be part of this wild world.During our travels, we will learn about the cultures of Tanzania's many ethnic groups and how they have historically co-existed with their environment.Tanzania's true treasure is the warmth and hospitality of its people.

We'll relax and get to know each other over a late snack--EXPANDFROMHERE--.Day 2: (Moshi) After breakfast, we'll have a trip orientation, then take a guided walk through rice fields showing everyday farm life of the local Tanzanian people and into the adjacent jungle to see colobus monkeys. In the afternoon, swim, relax, and prepare for the trek tomorrow. All meals today are at our hotel.Day 3: (Moshi-Lemosho Glades-Mkubwa Camp) We will shuttle from the hotel to Londorossi Gate: check in, meet our trekking staff, and collect our gear. Then we're in for an exhilarating ride on a primitive road to Lemosho Glades at 6,500 feet to begin our trek. We will hike at a slow, steady pace up 2,500 feet in three hours through montane forest to our first camp at Mti Mkubwa (big tree) at 9,000 feet.Day 4: (Mkubwa Camp-Shira Camp 1) We will move up and out of the forest nearly 2,500 feet in five hours into the giant heather moorland at 11,500 feet to Shira Camp 1. Often cloudy, this area is characterized by cool dampness. After a couple hours of rest in camp, we will take a short hike up a nearby ridge to aid in our acclimatization.Day 5: (Shira Camp 1-Shira Camp 2) Our hike will be a gradual climb of 1,100 feet for 3-4 hours up the Shira Plateau along a moorland meadow to Shira Camp 2 at 12,600 feet. The giant senecio trees come into view today. We will take another acclimatization hike before dinner. When the clouds clear, Kili is in plain view and exhibits some fine evening alpenglow.Day 6: (Shira Camp 2-Barranco Camp) Today is a long but scenic hike up 2,600 feet to the base of the Western Breach and the foot of the Lava Tower at 15,200 feet, a remnant of Kili's volcanic past. We will then descend 2,200 feet down the Barranco Valley through groves of senecio trees and lobelias to Barranco Camp at 13,000 feet; a total of seven hours. This scenic camp is situated below the Western Breach and Great Barranco Wall, which we will climb tomorrow. Great views of Kili draped with glaciers, Mt. Meru, and the possibility of a memorable sunset on the Breach and Barranco Wall await us today.Day 7: (Barranco Camp-Karanga Camp) The excitement today begins with the two-hour hand-over-hand climb up the Barranco Wall with amazing views the whole way. We will top out just below the beautiful Heim Glacier before descending into a steep canyon. We then begin climbing up to Karanga Camp at 13,800 feet, a climb of about a thousand feet over four hours. Remnant jagged peaks of Mawenzi -- an older, eroded volcano -- jut into the African sky. After a couple hours of rest, another acclimatization hike up a nearby ridge gives us a view of our next camp.Day 8: (Karanga Camp-High Camp) We hike to our high camp in alpine desert terrain above tree-line. Climbing over a couple of ridges, we join the exit trail, going up 2,000 feet in four hours past crowded Barafu Camp to our private, comfortable camp at 15,800 feet. This camp gives us an hour's head start up to the summit. The afternoon is spent preparing for our summit climb and getting some much needed sleep. It's off to bed after an early dinner.Day 9: (High Camp-Uhuru Peak-Millenium Camp) Summit Day! Awake about 11:30 p.m., bundle up in warm clothes, down some hot tea and cookies, then begin the climb. Slowly (\u2018pole-pole\u2019), we'll make sunrise at Stella Point at 18,650 feet, the end of the steep climb. After a short break, continue more gradually to the highest point at Uhuru Peak, 19,341 feet. After summit photos, we head back to High Camp. Although the ascent may take 6-7 hours, we'll be able to glissade down fine scree in about three hours. After lunch and a short nap, we\u2019ll descend 3,300 feet in three hours to Millenium Camp, beautifully situated in the cloud forest at 12,500 feet.Day 10: (Millenium Camp-Mweka Gate-Moshi) We'll make our final descent of 7,000 feet to Mweka Gate in five hours through cloud forest on a trail that is sometimes slippery. Then we only have a short drive back to the hotel, to reach our lunch and hot showers. The afternoon is free for swimming and preparing for the safari. Dinner is at the hotel.Day 11: (Moshi-Tarangire National Park-Highview Hotel) We drive about four hours to reach Tarangire National Park, where migratory animals congregate at the permanent waters of the Tarangire River in the shade of baobab trees. Herds of gazelle, hartebeest, wildebeest, zebra, elephant, eland, and oryx crowd the lagoons. Accommodations and dinner are at the modern, comfortable Highview Hotel.Day 12: (Highview Hotel-Olduvai Gorge-Serengeti National Park) Our busy day starts with a visit to Dr. Frank's medical facility in Karatu. Expanding his staff and facility every year, he's brought trusted health care to the Maasai and local people. Moving on, we'll lunch at Olduvai Gorge where interpreters show us the famous sites of the Leakey's archaeological discoveries. By late afternoon we enter Serengeti National Park for our first game drive to seek out wildebeest, zebras, lions, and cape buffalo. We arrive at sunset to Serengeti Wild Camp, a luxurious, impermanent tented camp featuring comfortable beds, en-suite facilities, large screened windows, and patio chairs to view wandering giraffe or hear growling lions. We stay two nights here to enjoy the nocturnal sounds of the bush.Day 13: (Serengeti National Park) We will leave camp early to enjoy the dawn light and higher activity level of the predators. In the Serengeti, the earth's largest concentration of plains wildlife still roams free. Expect to see lion, cheetah, leopard, hyena, elephant, hippo, warthog, and cape buffalo. We will return to camp for midday lunch while the animals are resting in the heat of the day. A late-afternoon game drive will find the predators and prey active once again. Near sunset, we return to Serengeti Wild Camp for dinner.Day 14: (Serengeti National Park-Ngorongoro Crater-Highview Hotel) After an early morning game drive, depart for Ngorongoro Crater, a UNESCO World Heritage site -- 2,000 feet deep and the largest intact crater in the world (100 square miles). We'll picnic near bathing hippos and spend the afternoon finding leopard, cheetah, hyena, jackal, black rhino, and the magnificent black-maned lions. Birds are also abundant, including pink flamingo, ostrich, Kori bustard, hornbill, and the beautiful grey-crowned crane with its unique headdress. You'll be surprised how close we can get to all these animals in our vehicles. In the evening, we return for another night at the Highview Hotel.Day 15: (Highview Hotel-Lake Manyara National Park-Moshi) We will have an early morning arrival at Lake Manyara National Park to see the famous tree-climbing lions, elephant families tending to their babies, fluorescent flocks of pink flamingoes, and the humorous antics of playful baboons. In the afternoon, we will drive back to Moshi for our farewell dinner at the hotel.Day 16: (Depart Springlands Hotel to Kilimanjaro International Airport) Relax, swim, and pack before we transfer in the afternoon to the airport for our flights home with great memories of Kilimanjaro, the Serengeti, and incredible wildlife to cherish for the rest of our lives.","leader1":"Melinda Goodwater","leader2":"Rick Russman","leader3":""}},{"trip":{"title":"Dolomiti di Brenta: Hut-to-Hut Trekking in the Trentino Alps, Italy","id":"18785A","dates":"Sep 1, 2018 to Sep 9, 2018","destination":"Europe, Italy","type":"International","group":"","difficulty":"","priceHigh":"2695","priceLow":"2695","image":{"src":"https:\/\/content.sierraclub.org\/outings\/sites\/content.sierraclub.org.outings\/files\/styles\/trip-teaser\/public\/trips\/main-images\/17770_1_BillFlower.jpg?itok=KR860sh9","alt":"Dolomiti di Brenta: Trekking the Trentino Alps, Italy"},"path":"\/outings\/dolomiti-di-brenta-hut-hut-trentino-alps-italy#trip=18785A","overview":"The TripThe Dolomites of northern Italy are among the most dramatic mountains on Earth.

Each afternoon we return to a cozy, car-accessible campsite for cold drinks, a warm meal and, possibly, a hot fire.We will be car-camping in two national park campgrounds and shuttling to trailheads each morning. On a layover day in the middle of the week, our location changes from the South Unit of the park to the North Unit, 70 miles away.A night at the Medora Musical is included in the trip price. This two-hour musical review in the open-air Burning Hills Amphitheatre\u00a0\u2013\u00a0less than 10 miles from our campsite\u00a0\u2013\u00a0is a kaleidoscope of entertainment enjoyed by as many as 2,900 people each summer night.Theodore Roosevelt credits his time here for creating his interest in conservation. Later as president he established five national parks, 18 national monuments, 150 national forests, and dozens of federal reserves \u2013 230 million acres in all. America\u2019s legacy to preserve and protect special places didn\u2019t start here, but it influenced a president who did more of it than any other.Join us for this first-ever Sierra Club trip to Theodore Roosevelt National Park to wander and wonder in a remote, uncrowded place. Walk through prairie dog towns and detour cross-country around herds of bison. Hike out of a steep canyon to a flat plateau that stretches for miles. Wade across a calf-deep stream. Enjoy long views of the Little Missouri River. Imagine an ancient forest, now petrified. \u00a0This trip is not for everyone, but if you want a hiking vacation in a sometimes challenging but beautiful place, Dayhiking in the Badlands of Theodore Roosevelt National Park may be the right place for you.\u00a0","highlights":"Celebrate our first-ever outing to this park, Explore stunning scenery on challenging day hikes, Enjoy abundant wildlife","includes":"  Inspiring camera-clicking views,   Highly rated meals in cozy campgrounds,   A night at the famous Medora Musical ","itinerary":"Day 1: Our week in the Little Missouri River Badlands begins midafternoon in Cottonwood Campground in the Southern Unit of the park.

The trailhead is on the Scenic Loop Drive, and it proceeds through hilly terrain and along picturesque Jones Creek. We\u2019ll stop on the ride back to camp to visit one of the park\u2019s largest prairie dog towns, and tonight we\u2019ll enjoy the famous Medora Musical--EXPANDFROMHERE--.Day 3: Most of today\u2019s challenging 9.6-mile hike is in the Theodore Roosevelt Wilderness within the park. The Lone Tree Loop presents many of the park\u2019s scenic landscapes, including Big Plateau. After climbing out of chiseled canyons, Big Plateau looms flat as a plate to the horizon. Depending on conditions, at least one calf-deep water crossing may be required.Day 4: A 45-minute drive to the remote northwest corner of the park will take us to a 10.3-mile loop, beginning and ending in the Petrified Forest, connected by several miles of rugged wilderness. We will see remnants of an ancient forest with trees that were 12 feet in diameter and more than 100 feet tall.Day 5: On today\u2019s layover day, we\u2019ll pack up camp and move independently 70 miles to the park\u2019s North Unit. Today is an opportunity to complete the Scenic Drive Loop and stop at a number of overlooks and short loop hikes, and to be tourists in Medora. We will regroup for dinner in cozy Juniper Campground.Day 6: Back in the wilderness, today\u2019s 6.2-mile hike on the Buckhorn Trail features deep canyons, rolling open prairies, and a large prairie dog town.Day 7: The Caprock Coulee Trail is a 4.2-mile loop that begins as a nature trail but soon becomes more challenging. Part of the hike hugs a ridgeline with long views of the Little Missouri River Valley.

It won\u2019t be for long as more people discover the beauty of this small country. This trip will take you to the most scenic areas of the western half of the country, and briefly to Italy. We'll hike most days; share cultural experiences visiting castles, farms, and quaint villages; enjoy two boat rides; and of course partake in local cuisine.Slovenia is a country that is full of charm and grace, richly blessed with natural wonders, and a place where green prevails. Only about the size of New Jersey, and squeezed between Austria, Italy, Hungary, and Croatia, this small Slavic country is an undiscovered gem in the middle of Europe. It enjoys an enviable mosaic of landscapes, which we will experience, including turquoise rivers, deep gorges, crystal clear lakes, karst caves, scenic green lowlands, the soaring Julian Alps, fairy-tale castles, and a touch of the sun-kissed Adriatic.Slovenia's cultural splendors are as diverse as its geography. In the ancient period the region was conquered by the Romans and it later became an important part of the sprawling Venetian Republic. During the Austro-Hungarian Empire, today's Slovenia was the playground of the Hapsburgs. Italian influence on the coastline, however, was a constant force until the entire region fell to Tito of Yugoslavia. Today, after more than 25 years of independence, Slovenia remains proudly Slavic, but no modern Slovenian denies the importance and prevalence of other\u00a0influences.","highlights":"Hike in Triglav National Park at foot of Julian Alps, Visit castles, turquoise rivers, and the Adriatic Coast, Boat to Bled Islet, Slovenia\u2019s only natural island","includes":"  All on-trip transportation and all gratuities,   All meals except two dinners,   Lodging in comfortable hotels","itinerary":"The leaders will make every reasonable effort to meet the goals outlined in the itinerary.

After a short welcome meeting, we take a short bus ride to our trailhead. From there we will enjoy a very pleasant hike on the Bloke Plateau on a long, but relatively flat, path taking us past villages, rivers, and a lake. A very special lunch is at our friend's home, where we will enjoy a variety of incredible dishes prepared just for us. In the afternoon we will check into our first hotel in Postojna, and later we enjoy our first dinner together as we get to know our fellow companions.\u00a0Sleep in Postojna--EXPANDFROMHERE--.Day 2: \u0160kocjan Caves and Predjama CastleToday we learn about the Karst area of Postojna with a visit to the impressive \u0160kocjan Caves, the most significant underground phenomena in the Karst region of Slovenia and a UNESCO World Heritage site. From time immemorial, people have been attracted to the gorge where the Reka River disappears mysteriously under a rocky wall. Archaeological research has shown that people lived in the caves and the surrounding area in prehistoric times (from the Mesolithic, the Neolithic, the Bronze and Iron Ages through Antiquity and the Middle Ages to the present \u2014 that makes more than 5,000 years!). In the afternoon we visit Predjama Castle. Perched high on a cliff, it officially dates back to the 16th century, but there are traces that go back much further to when it is said to be the living quarters of the robber knight \u201cErazem.\u201d Dinner on your own, included in the trip price. Sleep in Postojna.Day 3: Trieste, Italy, and the Adriatic coastWe will make our way to the outskirts of Trieste, Italy, visiting the Italian\/Slovenian border, and then take a walk overlooking the beautiful Adriatic Sea and Gulf of Trieste. We will have a very special lunch prepared at an agriturismo, where we will enjoy an unending sampling of specialties prepared on the farm\/winery.\u00a0We continue to Portoro\u017e, our home on the Adriatic coast for the next two nights. There will be time on our own to take a dip in the Adriatic before we meet for dinner.\u00a0Sleep in Portoro\u017e.Day 4:\u00a0Natural Reserve Se\u010dovlje and HrastovljeOur morning begins with a guided visit to the Natural Reserve of Secovlje, one of the most important wetlands of Europe. The Se\u010dovlje salts flats are the northernmost salt flats in the Mediterranean and part of a complex ecosystem. The salt is produced in the traditional way, based on a 700-year-old method that harmonizes man and nature.Afterward, a short drive takes us away from the coast to the small fortified church of the Holy Trinity in Hrastovlje. This church from the 1400s hosts a very special cycle of frescoes representing the \u201cDance of Death,\u201d where a large number of local characters are led into the afterlife by dancing skeletons. The characters may be rich or poor, handsome or ugly, but no matter what they do, they will all die, so they should behave well today in order to escape damnation in the afterlife.\u00a0These paintings are arguably the most important and best preserved in Slovenia and they give us a vivid idea about the way people thought about life and death 700 years ago.In the afternoon we go by boat from Portoro\u017e to Piran, a lovely coastal village that is enchanted with a Venetian vibe. Most likely founded by Celts, it was part of the Venetian Republic from the 1200s until the end of the 1700s. After a short Austrian dominion, it was Italian again up to 1954. At that time the area became part of Yugoslavia and most of its population went to Italy. With Slovenia\u2019s independence, great efforts were made not to lose this area\u2019s Venetian and Italian culture. Dinner is in Piran on your own, at participants\u2019 expense. Sleep\u00a0in Portoro\u017e.Day 5:\u00a0Discovering the So\u010da RiverThis morning we will leave the coast and head deep into the mountains to reach the beautiful area around the So\u010da River. The Italian name of the river is Isonzo and it was coveted by Napoleon, the Austrians, and the Italians for a long time. Several of the most important battles of WWI were fought here between Italian and Austrian troops. It is a dramatic irony that trails once used for war are now such peaceful tributes to tranquility and nature. After our hike we will reach the small town of Bove\u010d\u00a0and check in at our hotel. Sleep in Bove\u010d.Day 6:\u00a0Kobarid and the Walk of Peace hikeKobarid is a peaceful village with a distinctive Italian character, but it also holds a secret: it is the site of the greatest defeat of the Italian army during WWI. This moment in history was well pre-served in Hemingway's masterpiece\u00a0\u201cA Farewell to Arms.\" Hemingway lived here for awhile and really loved this area. Today we will hike in the name of peace for all time. We hike to a waterfall at the end of a beautiful canyon and end the afternoon with a visit to the Kobarid Museum of the First World War before heading back to Bove\u010d\u00a0for dinner\u00a0(on your own, at participants\u2019\u00a0expense). Sleep in Bove\u010d.Day 7: Vr\u0161i\u010d Pass and Vintgar GorgeThis morning we will drive over Vr\u0161i\u010d pass, Slovenia\u2019s highest road pass, en route to our next destination. The road, built by Russian war prisoners during the First World War, runs through the heart of the Julian Alps, and the views from the road simply call out for a stopover. A short walk at the summit of Vr\u0161i\u010d pass provides an opportunity to stretch our legs, have a coffee in one of the mountain huts on the way, and enjoy an exceptionally good view of other summits on both sides of the pass.\u00a0Later, we will walk along Vintgar Gorge, carved by the pristine Radovna River, within Triglav National Park. Triglav is Slovenia\u2019s only national park and one of the earliest national parks in Europe. We will then check in at our hotel near Bled. Sleep near Bled.Day 8:\u00a0Hike near Bohinj LakeToday we enjoy a day hiking the very scenic trails around Lake Bohinj, which boast breathtaking views of the beautiful Julian Alps. We will climb to Slap (Falls) Savica and end the day with a great dinner of local specialties. Sleep near Bled.Day 9:\u00a0Mostnica GorgeA very pleasant and scenic hike along the Mostnica Gorge takes us up the Voje valley, where we will enjoy a lunch of local stews. We\u2019ll also explore the small villages that dot the area around the lake. These villages are a world away from our daily lives and the culinary heritage alone is worth the trip. Sleep near Bled.Day 10: Bled\u00a0and RadovljicaToday we head to Lake Bled, an amazing jewel of nature nestled at the foot of the Julian Alps. Slovenia\u2019s only island, Bled Islet is located in the middle of an alpine lake with mountains as a backdrop. This spectacular location inspired Slavic populations to venerate Ziva, the goddess of love and fertility. Later, Christians built a church here that is still visited by pilgrims today. We cross the lake by traditional pletna boat to Bled Islet, visit Bled's castle, and enjoy a walk offering breathtaking views of the lake. After a lunch of fresh trout, we will discover the quaint village of Radovljica and visit the lovely museum of apiculture. We then head to Katzenstein mansion in Begunje \u2014 used by the Gestapo as a prison during WWII \u2014 where we see a small museum dedicated to the memory of its former prisoners. It is an extremely meaningful experience to visit this place \u2014 an important but sad reminder of a part of world history we can't forget. Sleep near Bled.Day 11: LjubljanaThis morning we move to Ljubljana where we take a walking tour around the city and discover why Ljubljana was named the European Green Capital of 2016. The city was the obvious choice for the capital when Slovenia achieved independence in 1991. Ljubljana has always been a bridge between the German, Latin, and Slav cultures due to its geographic location. This cultural diversity is visible in the complex architecture along the river canals of the city center. We will walk up to the Ljubljana Castle, where we have 360-degree views overlooking the city. In the afternoon there will be time to explore Ljubljana on your own before enjoying our farewell meal, which will make our last day memorable! Sleep in Ljubljana.Day 12: Transfer to Ljubljana airport to go back to U.S.This morning, you can catch your flight back to the U.S., or you can begin an extra adventure of your own and discover more of this beautiful town.\u00a0","leader1":"Carol Marty","leader2":"Nan Korutz","leader3":""}},{"trip":{"title":"Hiking the Peaks and Valleys of the Dolomites, Italy","id":"18805A","dates":"Sep 3, 2018 to Sep 14, 2018","destination":"Europe, Italy","type":"International","group":"","difficulty":"","priceHigh":"3295","priceLow":"3295","image":{"src":"https:\/\/content.sierraclub.org\/outings\/sites\/content.sierraclub.org.outings\/files\/styles\/trip-teaser\/public\/trips\/main-images\/18805_20_LauraBondsJohnson.jpg?itok=JIkso11H","alt":"Hiking the Peaks and Valleys of the Dolomites, Italy"},"path":"\/outings\/hiking-peaks-valleys-dolomites-italy#trip=18805A","overview":"The TripThe Dolomites are famous for their surreal beauty, with rugged, pale white, gray, and pink peaks rising abruptly from rolling green valleys. Geologically they have strong contrasts being composed of both dolomitic limestone and volcanic formations. The cultural heritage of the area also has contrasts; with Italian, Ladin, and Tyrolean influences. In fact, most villages and towns have three names; Italian, German, and Ladin. The Ladins were in the region before the Romans came and were never totally absorbed. The thousands of years of occupation have left their mark on the land, an impact we will acquire firsthand knowledge of.

In September, days are usually sunny and temperatures are mild.\u00a0The Sierra Club experience is exceptional -- not only do you get to hike in some of the best places in the world, but you get to do it in the company of a group of folks who share your values about the wilderness and why it matters.

It was first suggested by Alfred Wainwright, a British fellwalker, guidebook author, and illustrator (1907-1991), and describes a 190-mile walk, in an approximate beeline, having a preference for the high ground and crossing some of England\u2019s most stunning countryside. Our walk covers 90+ miles of the original route and begins at St. Bees Head on the coast of the Irish Sea--EXPANDFROMHERE--. We will walk through three of England's national parks: the Lake District, renowned for its gorgeous lakes and craggy peaks; the Yorkshire Dales, with its gentle green valleys full of ancient stone walls and old farms, and popularized by the PBS series,\u00a0All Creatures Great and Small; and the North York Moors, which is secluded and lush with heather, and ends at a picturesque coastline along the North Sea. Along the way we will stop in remote and quiet old country villages and hamlets to refresh ourselves in pubs and tea rooms and we\u2019ll also take time to wander through medieval ruins and monuments giving evidence of England\u2019s ancient history.Our adventure begins with a visit to Carlisle Castle, which has been standing guard for over 900 years. Our luggage will be shuttled by van daily to the next B&B, leaving us free and unburdened to enjoy our day with just a day pack. Our walks vary in length from 7\u201313 miles each day and on occasion, our van will transport us across sections of this classic walk.We will be accompanied by some local ramblers on several walks and they will also join us for dinner, giving us insights into the rhythm of life in rural England. This part of England had a vibrant history in mining -\u2013 we\u2019ll cross landscapes showing evidence of lead, coal, and iron mining reaching back into the early 18th century.The following is a tentative description of our day-to-day activities, giving a flavor of what you can expect on this trip. Inclement weather or poor trail conditions could require changes to the itinerary.","highlights":"Walk through some of England\u2019s most scenic countryside, Tour ancient monuments and ruins, Enjoy charming English villages and their local pubs","includes":"  All accommodations,   All meals, entrance fees, and gratuities,   Luggage transfers each day","itinerary":"Day 1: Carlisle to St. Bees. Our trip officially begins after breakfast, when we meet to review the day\u2019s activities, address any last-minute questions, and then take off on a walking history tour of the castle and the town of Carlisle. After lunch, our van will take us to St. Bees and our accommodations. This is about a one-hour drive away. After checking in, we have a tour of St. Bees Priory--EXPANDFROMHERE--. This site originated in the 7th century as a nunnery established by St. Bega and later became a Benedictine Priory in the 12th century. We regroup again afterward for dinner.Day 2: St. Bees to Cleator. (9.4 miles, elevation change +1,100 feet, -1,000 feet) After the traditional dipping of our boots into the Irish Sea, we will begin the ascent and traverse of St. Bees Head, a three-mile-long promontory that ends in cliffs that fall 300 feet to the Irish Sea. On a clear day, you can see the Lakeland fells (hills) to the east and the Isle of Man to the west. Following lunch at a small village, we wind our way through a network of fields and lanes to Cleator. At the end of today\u2019s walk, we take some time for well-deserved refreshments at a local pub before being transported to our B&Bs to freshen up for dinner.Day 3: Ennerdale Bridge to Honister. (11.5 miles, +1,400 feet, -600 feet) We begin by walking along the shore of Ennerdale Water, the westernmost lake in the Lake District, to Ennerdale Forest. After a lunch break at Black Sail Youth Hostel, formerly a shepherd\u2019s hut, we have a strenuous 1,000-foot climb over Honister Pass, overshadowed by the magnificent mountain scenery of Pillar (2,927 feet) and Great Gable (2,949 feet) and the rugged Haystacks, where Wainwright\u2019s ashes are scattered. The path leads down to Honister Quarry, where we will visit one of the oldest slate mines still operating. From there, we will board our waiting bus to our B&B accommodations at Borrowdale, a very picturesque Lakeland valley.Day 4: Stonethwaite to Grasmere. (8.5 miles, +1,950 feet, -2,050 feet) Our second day in the Lake District starts by walking into the secluded side valley of Stonethwaite, dominated by Eagle Crag. Next is Greenup Edge, the pass separating Borrowdale and Grasmere in the Far Easedale valley. Pending fine weather after lunch, we may elect to continue up to the summit rocks of Helm Crag, better known as \u201cThe Lion and The Lamb,\u201d an amazing array of pinnacles and tilted rock slabs. Following our ascent, we\u2019ll descend into the historic village of Grasmere, the birthplace of William Wordsworth. We will overnight in Grasmere.Day 5: Grasmere to Patterdale. (8.5 miles, +1,900 feet, -1,600 feet) Today we have a gradual climb up to Grisedale Pass, where we\u2019ll stop to enjoy the view of Grisedale Tarn (lake) below, backed by Dollywagon Pike. Beyond the pass we descend to walk alongside the lake between Helvellyn Peak (3,118 feet) and St. Sunday Crag, and continue onwards to Glenridding, where we will spend the next two nights.Day 6: Howtown to Glenridding. (6.5 miles, +1,000 feet, -1,000 feet) Today we will deviate from Wainwright's classic route to see the gorgeous Ullswater Lake, the second largest lake in the Lake District and shaped like a dog\u2019s leg. We take a boat ride on one of the historic passenger vessels from lakeside Glenridding to Howtown. Afterward our return hike follows the lakeshore back to our accommodation in Glenridding.Day 7: Sunbiggin Tarn to Kirkby Stephen. (6.4 miles, +600 feet, -1,000 feet) The day starts with a bus ride to shorten what would otherwise be a 22-mile walk. The hills in this area are gentler and our route less rocky than in the Lake District. After crossing near Rayseat Pike and the lower slopes of Crosby Garret Fell, we will see the site of the prehistoric village of Severals in the valley of Smardale, and the lime kilns on Smardale Fell. We'll continue walking to the old market town of Kirkby Stephen, where we will stay the night.Day 8: Kirkby Stephen to Keld. (12 miles, +1,900 feet, -1,450 feet) We will begin the 1,570-foot climb to Nine Standards Rigg, large cairns dating back to at least pre-18th century. Two important milestones are reached in this section of the walk; we enter Yorkshire Dales National Park, and we cross the watershed of the Pennines at the highest point of the fell -- 2,178 feet. We will descend to Keld for the night.Day 9: Keld to Gunnerside. (8.5 miles, +500 feet, -800 feet) We will follow the course of the River Swale along the valley floor. From Keld we will cross the river by a footbridge near East Gill Force (waterfall) and climb to the ruins of Crackpot Hall (a former lead mining area), then down to the path along the river. There are many old mines in this area, dating back to the 17th and 18th centuries, together with evidence of lead extraction from the Roman time period. Then we walk on to Gunnerside where we meet our bus and ride on to Richmond for a well-deserved rest day.Day 10: Rest day in Richmond, North Yorkshire. Richmond is a large, historic town founded by the Normans in 1071 \u2013- the castle and its keep still dominate the surroundings. The Georgian period, in the late 17th and 18th centuries, marked Richmond\u2019s heyday, with much elegant architecture being erected around its cobbled marketplace, reported to be one of the largest in England. A walking tour is planned in the morning for those who wish to join. The rest of the day is free to explore the many attractions, parks, gardens, or Richmond Castle, or to just wander along the River Swale to Easeby Abbey.Day 11: Swainby to Clay Bank Top. (8.5 miles, +2,200 feet, -1,600 feet) Before our hike begins, our bus will take us for a tour at Mount Grace Priory, a ruined Carthusian monastery dating from 1398. We are now in the North York Moors National Park. Wainwright described the moors as \"unenclosed, uninhabited, remote from industry and noise and free from traffic -- a magnificent territory for the walker.\" We will pass the well-known landmark of the Wainstones on Hasty Bank, and then descend to Clay Bank Top, where we will be met by bus and taken to nearby Great Broughton for a night's stay.Day 12: Clay Bank Top to Lion Inn at Blakey. (9.0 miles, +1,000 feet, -500 feet) As we leave Clay Bank Top, the ground will rise steadily across Urra Moor, the highest point of the North York Moors. There are beautiful views of Bransdale, Farndale (famous for its daffodils in spring), and Rosedale. We will enjoy refreshments in Blakey at the venerable Lion Inn, which dates back to 1553. Our bus will then take us to the North Sea town of Whitby where we will stay our last two nights.Day 13: Whitby to Robin Hood's Bay. (6.5 miles, +1,000 feet, -1,000 feet) Leaving Whitby, we\u2019ll pass the dramatic Whitby Abbey, which inspired Bram Stoker to write Dracula. From there we'll continue along the coast on the Cleveland Way a few miles until we rejoin the Coast-to-Coast track. Today\u2019s walk will take us along the cliff tops overlooking the North Sea and drop us into the picturesque smugglers village of Robin Hood\u2019s Bay, where we will ceremoniously and triumphantly dip our feet in the North Sea, enjoy a walk through the charming and historic village, and have lunch at a seaside pub. After lunch we will visit Whitby Abbey, founded in 657, and the town of Whitby. Following today\u2019s activities, we will gather for our farewell dinner.Day 14: Whitby to York. Our bus will depart at 9 a.m. for York, a journey of about two hours. We will say goodbye here, after accomplishing a remarkable feat.

While the crew prepares for departure, you can relax in the Discovery\u2019s cozy salon and enjoy specially prepared appetizers of smoked salmon or halibut spread with crackers, fresh baked breads, fruits, and a plentiful selection of fine beverages--EXPANDFROMHERE--. \u00a0Days 3-6:\u00a0Mornings aboard the Discovery are usually relaxed with a casual open breakfast served from 8:00 a.m. until 10:00 a.m. Enjoy a variety of warm fresh breads, muffins, rolls, fruits, cereals, various warm egg dishes, juices, coffee and tea.As we enjoy our breakfast each day, Captain Rand will study winds and weather, and decide on the route for the day, as well as the activities that can be safely offered.\u00a0 After either a Zodiac ride to shore for a walk or an outing by kayak, we return to our ship for a delicious cooked lunch, and in the afternoon are in position for another activity.We aim for either a kayaking activity or a shore walk between breakfast and lunch, and another similar activity between lunch and dinner.\u00a0 We could also choose to spend a lengthy time at the base of a glacier, simply watching the calving that occurs over time, and observing the rich bird and seal life that find refuge on the ice chunks near the base of glaciers. Participants may choose to remain onboard during any given activity if they simply wish to relax.As we motor through the sound, the captain and crew will be on the lookout for interesting wildlife, and will alert us to passing otters, whales, dolphins, seals, jellies and unusual birds. We are also always scanning for black bears that may be foraging along the shore.Lunches aboard Discovery often include an appetizer or a delicious warm soup, plus a hot casserole. Dinners are typically served with a salad, vegetables, and a meat or vegetarian entr\u00e9e. Dessert is always a treat to look forward to. It is amazing to experience the delicious and varied gourmet meals and snacks that can be produced for us in the small galley of our ship!There are wonderful routes east or south through the sound, but a precise sailing itinerary is impossible to predict in advance.\u00a0 We may find ourselves visiting small rocky islets where sea lions haul out to bask in the sun, following the intricate shorelines of larger islands, or gliding quietly through narrow passages where we get close views of the old-growth forests of Western hemlock and Sitka spruce.On several days we will experience the splendor of massive tidewater glaciers, noting the striated patterns of moraine inclusion and deep azure crevasses, watching and listening for the spectacular calving that is a constant feature of these rivers of ice. From our small ship we can safely approach the base, allowing for brilliant photos. As we approach any glacier we will be cruising through brash ice (smaller pieces of glacial ice) where seals and sea birds use larger chunks for safety as they rest or hunt. We\u2019ll stop to watch them as they watch us!The crew has a large inventory of interesting walks on shore, accessed by a short ride in a motorized raft, often uphill to glorious vantage points. On this fall trip we can expect to graze on wild blueberries and bog cranberries as we walk.\u00a0Many days we can look forward to finding calm places to explore by kayak. Discovery has a number of single kayaks on board and three double kayaks, all stable and easy to paddle.

Launching from Crystal Geyser just above a colorful canyon, we begin to meander peacefully downstream to the rhythm of dipping paddle strokes and settle into river time. The canyon grows deeper with every twist of the river as cliff walls rise sharply from the river\u2019s edge, displaying a rainbow of colors with the changing light of the day. Listen quietly and you will begin to hear the sounds of the desert, the soft wind in a cottonwood tree, the shriek of a peregrine falcon or the rumble of rock as a Desert Bighorn sheep comes down to the river at dusk. In the cool morning air, we\u2019ll hike up narrow side canyons to eerie panels of 800-year-old Indian rock art, which tell a story we do not fully understand. Our 60-mile guided paddle is considered the premier calm water canoe trip in the Southwest--EXPANDFROMHERE--.During this multi-activity adventure, we\u2019ll explore by canoe and trail the remote 1,500-foot depths of Labyrinth Canyons below the town of Green River, Utah until our takeout at Mineral Bottom. Several side canyons are geologically and scenically unique and reveal oasis-like microhabitats with spring-fed creeks that are a lush reprieve from the prickly pear cactus environment. Large cottonwood and box elder trees provide shade for humans and wildlife. There is adequate time for hikes through several of these wild side canyons. Then we\u2019ll jump back in the canoes and glide past red tail hawks, great blue herons, lizards, and stately mule deer. Scenic undeveloped campsites are abundant and accessible only by boat. \u00a0On the water we\u2019ll paddle past the vertical cliffs of the Carmel, Navajo, Wingate, and Monenkopi rock formations. These are some of the famous rock layers found in nearby Canyonlands and Arches national parks. The walls will light up with a distinct glow at sunset, often preceded by a brief afternoon thunderstorm and rainbow. This is a very remote desert wilderness with few man-made intrusions. The days are warm, so swims are a welcome addition to the day\u2019s activities.Ancient Fremont and more recently Ute Indians lived in these canyons as evidenced by cliff dwellings, rock art, and granaries. Almost every major side canyon along the river has Indian rock art, chipped petroglyphs, and painted pictographs. Bizarre anthropomorphs, desert animals, and daily life are portrayed on the stone. You\u2019ll also be following in the paddle strokes of Dennis Julian, a fur trapper who traveled the river by canoe and left his signatures in 1836.\u00a0 He was followed later by Major John Wesley Powell in 1869 whose expedition rowed heavy oak boats, recorded detailed scientific information, and named many of the prominent landscape features. During this outing, a special emphasis is placed on learning about the area\u2019s Indian culture, history, and stunning natural resources.Labyrinth Canyon has a mellow current and minor riffles, and no major rapids (rated Class II). Our two-person canoes should be able to pass through the canyons without great difficulty, but you\u2019ll need to paddle through the flat water sections. This makes it an ideal trip for persons who are active outdoors and experienced campers, but who may have little or no previous canoeing experience. More experienced canoeists will enjoy rhythmic paddling, the spectacular scenery, and the stories told by our expert guides. Participants will share a canoe with another person, help to carry group gear in their canoe, and assist in loading and unloading group equipment at camp. This is a shared experience.Camping is done on large sandbars or at the mouth of side canyons. Hikes are usually available at every camp.\u00a0 It is hot in the afternoon, with highs in the upper 80s and cooler in the morning with low temperatures in the 50s. We\u2019ll float in the river often to cool off and drink lots of provided water to stay hydrated. We follow Leave No Trace guidelines for desert river corridors to minimize our impact on this fragile environment, including using chemical toilets for solid human waste. There will be no plumbed or pit toilets available on the river. Sun protection is also very important. A complete checklist of what to bring will be provided by your leader upon acceptance. All meals are included from lunch on day one to lunch on day five.\u00a0 Every meal has fresh ingredients and ample quantities.During this shoulder season, we avoid the extreme heat of mid-summer without sacrificing warm weather and water. It's possible to have summer-like sun or cool fall days; rain, sometimes heavy; and ghostly morning fog. Do not make plans to leave the area on the last day of the trip in case we are delayed. Instead, join the group for a no-host celebration dinner after we get back to the town of Moab, Utah.Sights to see before or after the river trip:Visit the bizarre rock formations in Goblin Valley State Park outside Green RiverHike the trails of Arches National ParkView the fossils at the Cleveland Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry outside Price, UTExplore Nine Mile Canyon Archaeological PreserveCool off in high alpine meadows of the Highway 31 Energy Loop Nat\u2019l Scenic Byway","highlights":"Canoe slickrock desert canyons and hike side canyons, View ancient Indian rock art and pioneer history sites, Observe bighorn sheep and other desert wildlife","includes":"  Two-person canoes, canoeing gear, and most meals,   Licensed professional guides,   Information on natural history and Indian cultures","itinerary":"Pre-Trip:\u00a0Plan to arrive no later than mid-to-late afternoon Sunday.

We will receive a safety orientation, basic paddling instruction for those who wish, and a demonstration on the best way to load our canoes. Then we\u2019re off on our 60-mile descent downriver. A stop for lunch on a pretty beach will be next, then on to camp by 2-4 p.m. Canoes will be unloaded as a group activity, and everyone can set up their tents while the guides assemble the kitchen and begin dinner preparations.Days 2-4: After eating a hearty breakfast and breaking down camp, we begin our first full day on the river. Depending on the campsite, we may begin with a hike to explore a side canyon or complete loading the canoes and paddling downstream. The San Rafael River flows into the Green, giving us more water and the opportunity to paddle through a confluence. \u00a0As the river cuts deeper into the rock formations, the walls rise above us, revealing the multitude of layers and colors of stone laid down millions of years ago. We will stop at the Trin Alcove -- made up of three lovely slot canyons that intersect at the river with great hiking possibilities -- and continue on into Labyrinth Canyon. Highlights include Bowknot Bend (where the river makes a complete loop coming back to a point only a few hundred yards from where it passed some seven miles upstream), Hell Roaring Canyon, and Horseshoe Canyon. Ancestral Puebloan (Anasazi) rock art called petroglyphs are seen in several areas, and granaries are common along the canyon walls. \u00a0Historic sites include the outlaw cabin supposedly used by Butch and Sundance in their horse thieving days, and Register Rock, where explorers and trappers left inscriptions dating as far back as 1836. There will be plenty of hiking opportunities, including from our campsites.Day 5: Our final day on the river will pass through more spectacular scenery as we come to the take-out at Mineral Bottom after lunch. Gear will be transferred from canoes to trailers and then we begin the 900-foot ascent up the Horsethief Trail in our shuttle vehicles. This is a very steep and precarious-switchbacked one-lane dirt road, 1.5 miles long, where we can take one last look at the river from the top. We should be back in Moab before 5 p.m. NOTE: If there has been heavy rain, Mineral Bottom road becomes impassable for shuttle vehicles and the end of our trip will be somewhat delayed.Tipping: Tips are not included in the trip price.

The Pacific Ocean views, wildlife, cultural history, and splendid biodiversity offer something for every hiker. The Seashore protects over 70,000 acres of sand dunes, beaches, grasslands, Douglas fir and pine forests, estuaries, marshes, lakes, waterfalls, and 80 miles of unspoiled, undeveloped coastline. This trip presents a leisurely opportunity to learn and develop backpacking skills, as well as to explore this special place--EXPANDFROMHERE--.We start by exploring parts of Point Reyes on a day hike, with visits to the Tule Elk Preserve (which coincides with the elk rutting season) and a view of elephant seal breeding grounds. Our five-day, 23-mile backpacking route is designed to be a perfect beginner trip. We will take time to teach backpacking skills and discuss Leave No Trace practices throughout our journey.

We\u2019ll walk to Tomales Point through the Tule Elk Preserve, home to around 450 tule elk. These elk are endemic to California, meaning they are found nowhere else but within the state, and were near extinction in the 1800s due to hunting and ranching. We will likely hear bugling and see elk bulls rounding up their harems, since it's their rutting season. This route entails a 6-mile round-trip hike with superb views of the coast and, if it is clear, the Farallon Islands, which are 20 miles off the coast in the Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary. Afterward, we will drive out to the southern end of the park. Depending on time and the weather, we\u2019ll visit either Chimney Rock to see the elephant seal breeding grounds or the lighthouse. From either of these points, we will possibly spot whales spouting as they make their migration south. Then we\u2019ll drive to our hostel lodgings, have dinner, and relax--EXPANDFROMHERE--.Day 2: In the morning, after breakfast and a shower, we will do a gear check and go over each hiker\u2019s equipment to be sure you are properly prepared (and not weighed down). Then we will pack up and head to the trailhead at Bear Valley, where we will spend some time at the visitor\u2019s center, take a hike on the mile-long Earthquake Trail, and have lunch. We finally put on our packs and start off in the afternoon. The hike up to Mt. Wittenberg is a 1,300-foot climb, our highest on the trip. It\u2019s a short 3-mile day to our first camping spot at Sky Camp, with its sweeping ocean view.Day 3:\u00a0After breakfast, we will head down four miles to our next stop at Coast Camp, in a grassy valley close to the beach and tide pools. This hike will be one of the highlights of the trip: we'll be hiking through shaded forests, through a sublime valley, and out onto high, open expanses overlooking the blue Pacific. Once at camp, we will have time to hike along the sand dunes to Limantour Spit and look for harbor seals and whales. The crashing waves of the nearby ocean will serenade us as we prepare dinner and take in a late-summer sunset.Day 4:\u00a0On our longest hike, we will backpack 8.5 miles down the coast to Wildcat Camp with dramatic ocean views and beach vistas.

Millions of visitors from around the world continue to make the pilgrimage to the heart of California's Sierra Nevada to stand in awe of its natural wonders including Half Dome, El Capitan, and Yosemite Falls. The surrounding national park boasts a diversity of natural beauty -- from sequoia groves to alpine meadows -- and microclimates that range from 2,000 to more than 13,000 feet in elevation--EXPANDFROMHERE--.\u00a0Yosemite's wonders have also inspired conservation efforts since the time of the Civil War, when Abraham Lincoln first signed the Yosemite Grant. The Sierra Nevada provided the muse for the young idealist and adventurer John Muir, who first coined the term \"The Range of Light\" and went on to co-found the Sierra Club. Muir's eloquence, along with the support of Teddy Roosevelt and the efforts of many early environmentalists, culminated in the establishment of a much larger Yosemite National Park by Congress in 1890 and the transfer of the Yosemite Grant to the National Park Service in 1906. In the 20th century, the famous photographer and Sierra Club activist Ansel Adams continued to publicize the need to protect and preserve this irreplaceable place of beauty and wonder.We will have the opportunity to continue in the footsteps of the conservationists who have come before us and learn more about this park's natural and cultural history. Bring your hiking boots and your curiosity; plan to explore and enjoy Yosemite while we work and play.The ProjectWe will work with the park's Vegetation and Ecological Restoration Program on the projects that are of the greatest importance to the National Park Service. Work may include removing invasive plant species, planting native species, and rehabilitating hiking trails. The National Park Service will provide tools and instruct us on the safe use of equipment.

The Grand Gulch cuts through the land on its way to the San Juan River leaving deep canyons with the relics, artifacts, and rock art of people long since departed. The earliest known inhabitants of Grand Gulch were called the Basketmakers, who lived here from 1500 B.C.E. to 750 C.E. They built pit houses, created pottery and ornate baskets, and painted and chipped art on the walls of their canyons. They learned to plant and cultivate corn, beans, and squash. The Basketmaker culture evolved into the Pueblo culture where they cultivated cotton, which they weaved into cloth. Their architectural skills developed creating stone masonry cliff dwellings and fine, highly decorated pottery--EXPANDFROMHERE--. During our week in the Grand Gulch, we will explore several canyons in search of the mysteries about the lives of these Ancestral Puebloans -\u2013 their homes, their farms, and their art. Exactly what each petroglyph means remains as much a mystery today as the fate of the Ancestral Puebloans, but that only enhances our appreciation of their beauty.Hiking through any of the numerous canyons of Grand Gulch is equally as fascinating, exquisite, and unexpected as the ancient rock art and dwellings. The enormous Cedar Mesa sandstone walls with their streaks of desert varnish tower hundreds of feet above us. \u00a0Our hikes will take us past sandstone shaped into enormous alcoves, abandoned meanders, natural arches, and free-standing pillars. \u00a0We may share our hike with shy and rarely seen creatures, such as cottontail or blacktail rabbits, pinon or deer mice, coyotes or gray foxes, ringtail cats, bobcats, cute and tiny spotted skunks, several kinds of reptiles and amphibians like the orange-headed spiny lizards or Hopi rattlesnakes, and flying dwellers, including several bat species and the golden eagle.Fall is a great time of year for hiking in Grand Gulch. \u00a0The days are warm but usually not hot, the nights are cool but usually not cold, and the days are long, giving us plenty of time to hike, explore, discover, admire, and share the beauty of the land today while pondering the lives of those from the past.At our base camp, the air is clear and the sky is free of light pollution so the Milky Way can dazzle us as we lie on our bedrolls and consider what people saw in the same stars nearly 3,000 years ago.","highlights":"Discover prolific rock art in Southeastern Utah, Hike through colorful desert canyons with hidden ruins, Watch the Milky Way stretch across an open, clear sky","includes":"  Unique rock art and ruins photo opportunities,   Delicious meals provided by leaders and prepared by all,   Van transportation from campground to all trailheads","itinerary":"Our goal each day is to hike a different canyon to a specific ruin or rock art.

Located approximately two miles from the town of Estes Park, Hermit Park has 1,362 acres of wetland meadows and forests showcasing ponderosa pine and aspen trees. Numerous habitats provide homes from wildlife, especially moose and elk. The altitude (as high as 9,000 feet) provides ample opportunities to view surrounding mountains and valleys. Trails are provided for hikers, mountaIn bikers, and horses. Portions of the Colorado Front Range Trail cross the park. Initiated by Coloradans in 2003, the trail will run from Wyoming to New Mexico -- 800 miles in length -- when completed--EXPANDFROMHERE--.\u00a0Historic sites and structures are found on this land that initially was an active cattle ranch. Cattle ranching continued until the 1960s, at which time the ranch became a corporate retreat, until it was acquired by the county.\u00a0The ProjectYou will contribute to the construction of a new trail in Hermit Park and\/or other projects to preserve the park. Our specific tasks will be determined by the Hermit Park staff based on what is most needed at the time. \u00a0We'll stay in a mountain cabin at the YMCA of the Rockies near the entrance to Rocky Mountain National Park, approximately three miles from Hermit Park. We will enjoy hearty vegetarian-friendly meals served family style and evenings swapping stories around the fire. On our days off you can hike the many trails, visit Estes Park, enjoy the many YMCA amenities, or head for mountain streams, meadows, peaks, or crystal clear lakes. You can sample some of the awesome views of valleys and mountain peaks from the trails in Hermit Park.This is one of two Service trips in the Rocky Mountains in September. This project is in Hermit Park, while the other trip is nearby in Rocky Mountain National Park.","highlights":"Build & maintain trails, Stay in mountain cabin at YMCA of the Rockies, Explore streams & meadows or relax during time off","includes":"  Lodging, hot showers -- with mountain views,   Hearty, vegetarian-friendly meals & snacks,   Great company & a chance to give back\/pay it forward","itinerary":"Day 1:\u00a0The outing begins at 4:00 p.m. with an introduction\/orientation meeting in the Administration Building.

We will hike the Presidential Range\u2014the highest and among the most beautiful mountains in the Northeast. We will spend our first night at the Appalachian Mountain Club (AMC) Highland Center Lodge and then four nights enjoying the comfort, cuisine, views, and camaraderie of three AMC high mountain huts: Mizpah Spring, Lakes of the Clouds, and Madison Spring. While at Lakes of the Clouds hut, we will hike up to the summit of Mount Washington (the highest peak in the Northeast).Some of the most thrilling hiking and spectacular scenery in the Eastern U.S. is in the 800,000-acre White Mountain National Forest (better known as \u201cthe Whites\u201d), one of America\u2019s most popular public lands, registering more visitors annually than Yellowstone and Yosemite combined. The area features many natural wonders, including magnificent rock formations (the most famous being The Old Man in the Mountain, which collapsed in 2003, but is still New Hampshire\u2019s state symbol), as well as Flume Gorge, waterfalls, swimming holes, vast forests, spectacular open vistas, high peaks and ridges, and fragile alpine vegetation. The Presidential Range high peaks are the highest mountains in the Northeast which culminate in the bare, schist metamorphic rock summit of Mount Washington (6,288 feet and \u201cHome of the World\u2019s Worst Weather\u201d). We will summit numerous peaks, which may include Jackson, Pierce, Eisenhower, Monroe, Jefferson, and Madison among others. This range forms the longest stretch of the Appalachian Trail above tree line.For large portions of this New Hampshire hiking trip, we will be above tree line in the alpine zone, where you will see krummholz (gnarled and stunted trees that survive where there is a bit of shelter from the violent winds), and tiny alpine flowers, some extremely rare. The flora is most similar to that of the eastern Canadian Arctic and Coastal Barrens.The White Mountain National Forest is a managed and multiple-use forest (including six designated Federal Wilderness Areas), that provides areas for recreation, wildlife habitat, and harvesting of trees\u2014a renewable resource. Moose, deer, fox, and black bear are abundant\u2014as are more than 184 species of birds.","highlights":"Enjoy a classic White Mountain Presidential traverse, Summit Mt.

On day two, we hike to the Mizpah Spring Hut. On day three, we cross the southern section of the Presidential Range to Lakes of the Clouds Hut\u2014high on the flank of Mount Washington. On day four, we summit Mount Washington, where we will tour the weather station, and then descend via the Alpine Garden Trail back down to Lakes of the Clouds Hut. On day five, we hike the northern section of the Presidential Range to Madison Spring Hut for our last night in the mountains. On day six, we hike down the Valley Way Trail to Appalachia Parking Lot and our cars--EXPANDFROMHERE--.Please note that the itinerary may change due to weather, trail conditions, or other considerations.Day 1: We meet at the AMC Highland Center Lodge between 1:00 and 2:30 p.m. At 3:00 p.m. we will spot a few cars at the Appalachia Parking Lot, where we will end our trip on day six (your cooperation and flexibility is needed to accomplish this). We have a \u201cmeet and greet\u201d event at 4:00 p.m. to introduce ourselves and enjoy light refreshments. Afterward we will check our gear and discuss trip details, including equipment, clothing, Leave No Trace principles, trail etiquette, and our itinerary. Dinner is at 6:00 p.m. After dinner we will finish up our orientation and gear check.Day 2: Following our 7:00 a.m. breakfast, we \u201cgear up\u201d and hike 2.6 miles (1,900 feet of elevation gain) on the steep Crawford Path to Mizpah Spring Hut (3,777 feet), where we will enjoy our lunch. In the afternoon, we take an optional 3.4-mile round-trip hike on moderate terrain across the ridge to Mt. Jackson (4,052 feet), our first summit (the mountain is named after Charles Thomas Jackson, a NH geologist in the 19th century).Day 3: From Mizpah Spring Hut we climb a very steep 535 feet to the summit of Mt. Pierce, above tree line, and remain above tree line until we descend on Day 6. We traverse the southern section of the Presidential Range on the Crawford Path\/Appalachian Trail (AT)\u20144.8 miles to Lakes of the Clouds Hut (5,012 feet). After Mt. Pierce we hope to summit Mt. Eisenhower (4,760 feet) and later in the day, Mt. Monroe (5,372 feet). At the hut we acknowledge our day's accomplishments, put up our feet, stretch out, and (on a clear day) enjoy the 80-mile views. After dinner keep an eye out for a spectacular sunset.Day 4:\u00a0We start our morning ascending 1.5 miles (1,276 feet elevation gain) to the summit of Mt. Washington (6,288 feet), the highest peak east of the Mississippi River and north of the Carolinas. The summit is also the terminus of the cog railway which was built in 1869 and is still in operation today. On the summit we will tour the Mount Washington Observatory weather station, enjoy our lunch, and explore. The Tip-Top House on the summit is a state historic site renovated with exhibits of Mt. Washington\u2019s long and varied history as the site of several hotels, an old coach road from 1861, the cog railway, and the Observatory weather station.Mount Washington is well worth the climb. The mountain is broad and massive with great ravines cut deeply into steep sides, leaving buttress ridges that reach up through the timberline. The timberline occurs at about 4,500-5,000 feet, the lowest in the world this close to the Equator, as a result of exposure to the mountain\u2019s fierce wind and weather. The summit cone is covered with fragments of rock and almost devoid of vegetation, rising steeply above the 5,000-foot upper plateau.The Mount Washington Observatory weather station performs weather and climate research along with innovative science education programs. It is one of only a handful of permanently staffed mountaintop stations in the world, and the only one of its kind in the Western Hemisphere. Mt. Washington\u2019s location at the convergence of three major storm tracks, combined with its elevation and unique topography, create extraordinary weather extremes unlike anywhere on Earth. Our tour will provide an opportunity to meet and interact with the scientists, learn how they create forecasts, see the instruments they use to capture Mt. Washington's legendary extremes, and more.The return to our hut will follow a different route along the Alpine Garden Trail. We will look for the unique alpine plants that grow below the summit of Mt. Washington while we enjoy views of the Huntington and Tuckerman Ravines and beyond.Day 5: We leave Lakes of the Clouds Hut on the Crawford Path\/AT and traverse the northern section of the Presidential Range on the Gulfside Trail\/AT, traveling about seven miles along open ridges and rock fields to the Madison Spring hut (4,800 feet). This trail offers extensive views and the option to summit Mt. Jefferson (5,716 feet).The name \"Gulfside\" was given by J. Rayner Edmands who, starting in 1892, located and constructed the greater part of the trail; sometimes following existing trails. Most of the trail is part of the Appalachian Trail, except for a very short segment at the south end. The Gulfside Trail forms the northwestern boundary of the Great Gulf Wilderness, though the path itself is not within the Wilderness.Day 6: On the last day we hike down from Madison Hut 3.8 miles (3,500 feet of elevation loss) via the Valley Way Trail to the Appalachia Parking Lot. From there we carpool back to our cars at the AMC Highland Center Lodge, where we will say our goodbyes and wish everyone a safe trip home. We should be at the Appalachia Parking Lot by 1:00-1:30 p.m. and back to our cars by 2:00-2:30 p.m.","leader1":"David Pearson","leader2":"Andrew Moss","leader3":""}},{"trip":{"title":"Creeks and Peaks: Dayhiking in Idaho's Sawtooth Mountains","id":"18242A","dates":"Sep 10, 2018 to Sep 15, 2018","destination":"United States, Idaho","type":"Lodge","group":"","difficulty":"","priceHigh":"1625","priceLow":"1625","image":{"src":"https:\/\/content.sierraclub.org\/outings\/sites\/content.sierraclub.org.outings\/files\/styles\/trip-teaser\/public\/trips\/main-images\/18242_21_TomBrown.jpg?itok=37GqpVPN","alt":"Creeks and Peaks: Dayhiking in Idaho's Sawtooth Mountains"},"path":"\/outings\/creeks-peaks-multisport-adventure-idaho-mountains#trip=18242A","overview":"The Trip\u201cThe spectacular beauty and varied world-class recreational opportunities (of the Sawtooth National Recreation Area) are arguably unmatched anywhere in the world.\" -The Sawtooth SocietyEighty million years ago the earth convulsed as two mighty tectonic plates collided. During this collision the continental plate slid under the oceanic plate. Along the seam created by the impact of the two plates, in an area that would later become known as Idaho. Colossal pressures were released and gigantic plumes of molten magma began rising to the surface of the earth\u2019s crust. As the plumes of magma rose they lifted up the overlaying crustal material above them. The magma cooled to become the Idaho Batholith -- the very roots of most of the state. Part of the overlaying material that was lifted up by the plumes of magma became the 40-mile-long Sawtooth Mountain Range--EXPANDFROMHERE--.Ever since the Sawtooth Mountains were lifted up they have been shaped and sculpted by nature\u2019s relentless forces. Rain and the combined effects of repeated freezing and thawing eroded the mountains. Glaciers ground and polished them as they gouged out over 400 alpine lakes. And the swift violence of earthquakes re-shaped them. Today these crenellated peaks are considered by many to be the most stunning mountains in all of the United States.Recognizing the importance of this magnificent land, Congress sought to protect it from development by creating the Sawtooth National Recreation Area (SNRA) in 1972. When you join this trip you\u2019ll venture into the SNRA to personally experience its overwhelming beauty. You will witness its geological history, wade in its crystalline streams, hike its remote trails, swim in its alpine lakes, and walk on its glacial moraines.\u00a0When you return home at the end of an unforgettable week you'll have a new appreciation for what John Muir meant when he said, \"Take a course in good water and air; and in the eternal youth of Nature you may renew your own.\"","highlights":"Hike wilderness trails to the feet of soaring peaks, Follow the banks of crystal creeks and alpine lakes, Enjoy the first blush of autumn in the high country","includes":"  All lodging in comfortable riverfront vacation homes,   All meals, with a sampling of high country cuisine,   Guided hikes including history and geologic details","itinerary":"Day 1: Arrival Day Your Creeks and Peaks adventure begins this afternoon with your arrival at our vacation homes located on the Salmon River a few miles outside the historic small town of Stanley, Idaho.

Our first hike is the perfect way to begin our hiking agenda because it offers the initial opportunity to experience close up the grandeur of the Sawtooth Mountains. It\u2019s a short hike with little elevation gain, and you\u2019ll walk through several ecosystems -\u2013 sagebrush, mixed forest of aspen and pine, beaver ponds, and meadows.Following the hike we\u2019ll visit a portion of the longest salmon migration in the USA, learn about the gold mining history of the region, visit a massive gold mining dredge, stroll through the ghost town of Custer, and maybe even soak in a geothermal pool.

This portion of the MNRR Water Trail is characterized by numerous braided channels separated by densely vegetated sandbars. The delta is the result of a significant amount of sediment from the Missouri River, Niobrara River and other tributaries entering the slower moving waters of Lewis & Clark Lake. The delta is set in a unique landscape and offers a paddling experience that is different from that of the Missouri River main channel. The current here is slower than that of the river, allowing paddlers to travel upstream with relative ease and therefore the option to begin and end at the same location. Both the delta and Lewis & Clark Lake offer several access points, most of which feature water trail signage. Much of the delta is bordered by steep bluffs of the chalky Niobrara Formation. The delta's many channels are separated by numerous sandbars that are mostly vegetated with common reed grass and cattails. Because of the numerous channels, we don't offer suggested routes through this portion of the water trail but rather encourage paddlers to explore the area on their own. While the delta is a great paddling experience, it also requires some preparation in terms of navigation. All who plan to paddle the delta should bring a GPS to aid navigation through the many channels this area has to offer.\u201d -- Missouri River InstituteEventually we will weave our way through the Delta and back to the South Dakota side of the river.\u00a0 We will reach our take-out point and be met by our canoe outfitter and charter bus.\u00a0 After a challenging and rewarding day of paddling, we will load up to head back to Sioux Falls and our hotel.\u00a0 We will enjoy our last dinner as a group in a local restaurant (not included in the trip price) and then back to the hotel. All meals included, excluding the restaurant dinner.Day 6: (Trip End)We will have breakfast at our Sioux Falls hotel breakfast bar, exchange farewells and hugs, and return to our modern lives enriched, informed, and rejuvenated by our time travel adventure.

Please keep in mind that weather or other conditions beyond our control may cause us to modify our plans to ensure the safety and well-being of the group.Day 1: (Pisa and Porto Venere)\u00a0Our adventure begins this morning when we meet at the front entrance of the Pisa rail station, then head to the center of the city to visit the spectacular Piazza dei Miracoli and world-famous Leaning Tower of Pisa.\u00a0(If you wish to enter and climb the tower, please\u00a0arrive a day early, as there is not time to do so on our tour day.) We then travel to Porto Venere and our hotel, where we will stay for the next two nights--EXPANDFROMHERE--. Today\u2019s highlights include Porto Venere\u2019s charming little church, its colorful houses, and ancient buildings (all part of a powerful fortress that defended Genoa against its rival Pisa). You will have time to stroll and enjoy an incredible seascape from \u201cLord Byron\u2019s window,\u201d the poet's favorite viewpoint in Porto Venere.Day 2: (Palmaria Island) After a short morning boat ride we arrive at the largest island of the region, Palmaria, just seaward of Porto Venere. Palmaria, together with the Cinque Terre and Porto Venere, is a UNESCO World Heritage site and has been inhabited for at least 5,000 years. We will explore the island's vast Mediterranean vegetation (more than 500 species) and enjoy breathtaking views over Porto Venere and a very impressive 19th-century military fortification. Hiking time: around three and a half hours, with 1,000 feet of elevation gain.Day 3: (Walk to the Cinque Terre)\u00a0We leave Porto Venere in the morning and hike to Cinque Terre (\"the Five Lands\") where five beautiful villages hang over the sea: Riomaggiore, Manarola, Corniglia, Vernazza, and Monterosso. Built in the 12th century, they are all part of a UNESCO World Heritage site today. Our hike begins with a steep but rewarding climb up the mountain behind Porto Venere to an expansive viewpoint over the Gulf of Poets. Later, our driver will take us to our hotel in Monterosso. We will have a pleasant stroll in the old town or a relaxing swim. Hiking time: around four hours, with 1,500 feet of elevation gain.Day 4: (Hiking in the Cinque Terre)\u00a0Today\u2019s hikes take us to two more Cinque Terre villages. Our first hike will be from Monterosso to Vernazza (about three hours and 800 feet of elevation gain). After a short visit to Vernazza we will hike to Corniglia (about two and half hours and 800 feet of elevation gain). Both trails are quite steep, but the views along these trails are stunning. After touring Corniglia we will take the train back to Monterosso.Day 5: (Monterosso to Levanto)\u00a0Our day begins with a steep uphill hike from our hotel to Punta Mesco, the promontory that is the natural divide between the Five Lands and the village of Levanto. (Hiking time: around three and a half hours total, with about 1,000 feet of elevation gain.) We will have lunch in Levanto. From Levanto we depart for a one and a half hour bus drive to our hotel through winding mountain roads. Our final destination for today is the seaside village of Camogli, where we will stay the next three nights.Day 6: (Portofino to San Fruttuoso)\u00a0A short bus ride takes us to the seaside village of Santa Margarita where we board our boat to\u00a0Portofino. Its breathtaking views and wonderful location transformed this fishing village into a tourist destination and the center of the summer\u2019s\u00a0dolce vita,\u00a0attracting countless writers, poets, painters, and movie stars. We will start hiking from the center of the village to the beautiful San Fruttuoso Abbey, built in the 11th century. From San Fruttuoso, we will take a boat back to Camogli to enjoy more of this beautiful coast. Hiking time: three and a half hours, with 1,000 feet of elevation gain. Here we will have another opportunity to swim in the Italian Riviera or tour the Abbey. Dinner is on your own tonight.Day 7: (San Rocco to Punta Chiappa)\u00a0Starting from the beautiful church of San Rocco di Camogli, 900 feet above Camogli, we have a pleasant, mostly downhill hike to the promontory of Punta Chiappa, which ends with a short boat ride back to Camogli. As a special treat, we will take the bus to Genoa for an historic walking tour of this fabulous city of World Heritage sites. After that we'll return for our last night in Camogli. Hiking time: two hours, with modest elevation gain.Day 8: (Capo Manara)\u00a0A 30-minute bus ride takes us to beautiful Sestri Levante, a village between the Baia del Silenzio (Bay of Silence) and Baia delle Favole (Bay of Fairy Tales). We will hike through a protected area on a trail sided by beautiful Aleppo Pines and Cork Oaks, a perfect combination with the expansive sea views. We will reach Punta Manara for more great views. After lunch we will have time to enjoy the lively city center or spend some time on the beach before we head for Noli and our hotel for the next two nights. Hiking time: two and a half hours, with 750 feet of elevation gain. We will have a one and a half hour bus ride to our Noli hotel after the hike.Day 9: (Noli to Varigotti hike)\u00a0Today\u2019s hike follows an ancient mule road that connected the villages of Noli and Varigotti before the modern route was built. We will walk past the Saraceni beach and the lovely church of San Lorenzo to reach Varigotti -- passing typical Mediterranean vegetation, including rosemary and arbutus plants -- and get to the dramatic cape viewpoint over vertical Triassic limestone cliffs. Our walk ends in Varigotti. After lunch we will bus back to Noli, which is part of the \u201cMost Beautiful Villages in Italy\u201d network. Hiking time: four hours, with about 1,300 feet of elevation gain.Day 10: (Bussana Vecchia and Menton, France)\u00a0A bus ride of one and a half hours takes us to our trailhead. Our hike this morning takes us to the ancient village of Bussana Vecchia. This medieval village was probably founded by the Romans and inhabited until 1887, when a violent earthquake hit it. At the end of the 1950s, artists from all over the world established a vital community based on ideals of common property and inspirational creativity. After a pleasant lunch in Bussana Vecchia, we drive 30 minutes toward the French border, stopping at a botanic garden for a refreshing break. After another 30-minute bus ride, we will reach our hotel in the French city of Menton. Hiking time: two and a half hours, with 600 feet of elevation gain.Day 11: (Eze)\u00a0This morning, we take the bus past Monaco, to a trailhead near Eze. We will hike about two hours, with 1,000 feet of elevation gain. Excellent views of the many galleries and the French Riviera are the reward. After that we will drive to a beautiful park, high above the town of Eze. After a picnic lunch we will drive back to Menton for a relaxing afternoon and the last night of our outing.Day 12: (Transfer to Nice)\u00a0After breakfast, our tour ends with fond farewells and a transfer to the airport in Nice, France.","leader1":"Erhard Konerding","leader2":"","leader3":""}},{"trip":{"title":"High Lakes of Yosemite National Park, California","id":"18170A","dates":"Sep 14, 2018 to Sep 22, 2018","destination":"United States, California","type":"Backpack","group":"","difficulty":"4 (out of 5)","priceHigh":"745","priceLow":"745","image":{"src":"https:\/\/content.sierraclub.org\/outings\/sites\/content.sierraclub.org.outings\/files\/styles\/trip-teaser\/public\/trips\/main-images\/18170_main_TomMiller.jpg?itok=yG4DiuoC","alt":"High Lakes of Yosemite National Park, California"},"path":"\/outings\/national\/brochure\/high-lakes-yosemite-national-park-california#trip=18170A","overview":"The TripBask in the glorious late summer light while trekking on-trail to the remote Lyell Fork of the Merced River.

Carved by wind and water over the centuries, the Red River Gorge is characterized by steep sandstone cliffs, overhanging rock ledges, and narrow valleys littered with boulders. It is also home to more than 100 natural sandstone arches, many of which can be seen from the area's 60+ miles of hiking trails.The 28,000-acre geological area has been designated a national natural landmark. Within the gorge is the Red River, a portion of which is designated as a National Wild and Scenic River. This unique river features both gentle ripples and exciting whitewater. The complex topography provides habitat for a rich diversity of plants and animals, including many rare species.This is a wonderful place for bird watchers, boasting more than 100 species. This time of year, migrating birds pass through to winter in the South. Common game species such as white-tailed deer, fox, squirrel, turkey, grouse, and quail are prevalent. Bobcat and coyote are present, although their secretive nature makes sightings rare. Instead of a few dominant plant species, 20-25 species share dominance, especially tulip poplar, sugar maple, beech, basswood, yellow buckeye, red oak, white oak, red maple, hemlock, black walnut, black cherry, shagbark hickory, white pine, and white ash.The ProjectThe exact project for this fall outing will be decided in early spring.

The focal point is the Youghiogheny River Gorge, which passes through the heart of the park. In 1753, George Washington tried to use the Youghiogheny River as a means to reach the French Fort Duquesne at the fork of the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers.

The Grand Canyon is a land of song.\"\u00a0\u2014\u00a0John Wesley PowellRafting down the Colorado River through the majestic Grand Canyon is North America's ultimate river trip. The Grand Canyon is one of the world's premier whitewater experiences. Since John Wesley Powell first traversed the Grand Canyon in 1869, the Colorado River has been known as the most exciting and challenging whitewater river in North America. This grand-daddy of a river boasts 150 major rapids, including Houserock, Hance, Sockdolager, Hermit, Upset, Lava Falls, and the Class V Crystal Rapid! The thrill of running such rapids remains long after the trip is over.Besides the whitewater excitement, there are also many quiet stretches of current. The fullness of the river experience is enhanced by its contrasts: gentle, powerful, and then gentle again. We will find sparkling clear springs gushing from cracks in the cliffs, forming lush oases of ferns, pools, and wildflowers, as well as cool quiet side canyons sculptured from the ancient rocks where the song of the Canyon wren echoes in the crystalline dry air. Each of Earth's climatic zones is represented in the Grand Canyon, from alpine forests on the rim to Sonoran deserts in the lower elevations. Some of the oldest rocks to be found anywhere on the planet form the canyon walls; the multicolored layers reflect more than two billion years of geologic time from the top to the bottom of the gorge.There is something here to excite everyone: geology, climate, vegetation, animal life, and human history. From the put-in at Lee's Ferry to the takeout 225 miles downstream at Diamond Creek, the traveler is never in want of awe. President Theodore Roosevelt once said of the Canyon: \"Leave it as it is. Man cannot improve upon it.\" This is what we intend to do, while enjoying the magnificent experience of our journey. \u00a0If you choose to go on this outing, it will be one of the most memorable and cherished experiences of your life.This trip is outfitted by O.A.R.S., a licensed concessionaire of Grand Canyon National Park.","highlights":"Raft or dory 225 miles on the Colorado River, Explore Redwall Cavern and amazing geology, Hike side canyons to ruins, waterfalls & swimming holes","includes":"  Professional guide service, rafts, dories, river gear,   Transportation to the river and back to Flagstaff,   Lodging in Flagstaff before and after the river trip","itinerary":"\"We are now ready to start on our way down the Great Unknown.

We\u2019ll cover the details of how to pack the bags, which items to pack where, and answer any last-minute questions--EXPANDFROMHERE--.\u00a0We plan to have a mix of oar-powered rafts and dories on our trip. These boats will carry us and all of our gear and food for 15 days through the canyons. Fortunately for us, the Grand Canyon is motor-free after September 15, so we will not have to listen to the whining of motor boats during our trip.\u00a0Our 18-foot, oar-powered rafts accommodate four passengers plus one guide rowing from the center of the raft. We will also have the option of 17-foot fiberglass dories, which slice through the waves and provide an unforgettable ride though the canyons. These elegant boats provide a connection to Powell and the history of western exploration, as well as a whole lot of fun. Our boats have the advantage of floating silently in the river, allowing us to savor, peacefully, the uniqueness of this place and to observe the wildlife undisturbed. Our rafts and dories have a safety record bested by none. In addition, these craft provide a more intimate sense of adventure, excitement, and oneness with the river.The morning after our meeting, we\u2019ll board a bus to Lees Ferry, our put-in for our Grand Canyon adventure. Navajo Bridge will give us our last view of \u201ccivilization\u201d as we embark on our journey. Our itinerary will vary day to day, depending on river flow, weather, the amount of hiking we do, and the inclination of the group. We will camp each night of the trip next to the river, mostly on sandy beaches.\u00a0The river carves through Marble Canyon, unveiling layer upon layer of textures and hues with half a billion years\u2019 of Paleozoic rock walls standing before us.\u00a0We encounter our first taste of whitewater as we meet up with Badger and Soap Creek rapids.Our boats float past the fern-covered oases of Vasey\u2019s Paradise.As the river bends we see the inviting limestone chamber of Redwall Cavern.We forge on downstream for a hike up to the Puebloan granaries of Nankoweap with epic vistas below.Back on the river, the rapids of Unkar, Hance and Sockdolager engulf us with excitement.\u00a0The canyon walls squeeze closer together, forming the crimson and black walls of Upper Granite Gorge.We navigate some of the biggest whitewater in the canyon, including Crystal, Sapphire, Turquoise and Ruby rapids.At Elves Chasm, we encounter fern grottoes with shimmering crystal pools while Blacktail Canyon engulfs us with ribbon-fluted walls looming overhead.Once again the canyon closes in as we enter Granite Narrows, the narrowest part of the canyon.A short distance ahead we hear the 125-foot downpour of Deer Creek Falls.We continue gliding through geologic time as we row our boats ashore to the limestone slot canyon known as Matkatamiba, where a wide natural amphitheater awaits our arrival.Upset Rapid gives us one last challenge before we camp for the night.We visit Havasu Canyon for time to hike or just relax along the blue-green cascading pools.We run the notorious Lava Falls as we descend into Lower Granite Gorge.We take out at Diamond Creek, then drive back to Flagstaff to our hotel for hot showers and our farewell dinner.\"Now the danger is over, now the toil has ceased, now the gloom has disappeared, now the firmament is bounded only by the horizon, and what a vast expanse of constellations can be seen!

Tucked into the northeastern corner of the U.S., Maine promotes itself as \u201cThe Way Life Should Be.\u201d As most people who have visited this state know, Maine has many special features. Most visitors appreciate the slow pace of the state\u2019s non-urban areas and enjoy the prevailing atmosphere of a step back in time. The Mid-Coast region of Maine features a deeply indented shoreline with snug harbors and long, uneven fingers of land jutting into Penobscot Bay. Every picturesque town at the end of each peninsula beckons with its own unique combination of lighthouses, fishing enclaves, and lobster wharves. The Bay itself is considered a sailor\u2019s dream with five large islands and scores of much smaller islands--EXPANDFROMHERE--. Ospreys and bald eagles nest in the spruces along the shore, puffins inhabit some of the islands, deer and moose forage in the woods, and harbor seals bask on rocks in quiet coves.Our trip begins in the seacoast town of Boothbay Harbor, famous for its picture-perfect scenery. Located at the bottom of the Boothbay Peninsula, the harbor is full of working craft and pleasure yachts. It is a harbor that windjammers and fishermen have called home for over 400 years. The town itself boasts many restaurants (specializing in seafood, of course), galleries, inns, and shops. Offshore are many small islands perfect as destinations for kayak trips, and onshore one can find parks and preserves perfect for hikes and picnics. We\u2019ll spend four nights at a waterside inn that will spoil us with\u00a0their sunny deck and Downeast buffet breakfast. We will have access to an outdoor hot tub in their nearby associated property.We\u2019ll use our inn as a base for activities on the Peninsula. These will include hiking in the surrounding mountains to vistas of the Bay, kayak instruction and guided tour of a protected river, a two-hour cruise on a sailboat, and a guided tour of the largest botanical garden on the coast of Maine. Since there are so many diverse and interesting activities that this area offers, participants will have one day to spend as they wish on their own: just relaxing, hiking, shopping, kayaking, bicycling, etc. Our meals will include many of the seasonal produce for which Maine is famous, such as blueberries, a myriad of fresh vegetables, and locally caught seafood, including its famous lobster.We\u2019ll spend the last two days of our trip on the small rocky island of Monhegan, 10 miles from the mainland and scarcely a square mile in area. There are just a few old trucks and no paved roads on the island. Most of its 75 year-round residents make their living from fishing, lobstering, or servicing summer tourists. Monhegan is undoubtedly the most famous island in Maine; thanks to its artists' colony, people have been attracted to it since 1880. Some of its well-known artists include Jamie Wyeth, Rockwell Kent, and Edward Hopper. Most of the island outside the small village is wild and protected by its 50-year old conservation association. Its wildlife sanctuary has more than 600 varieties of wildflowers and 200 species of birds along with 17 miles of trails. Visitors appreciate the beauty of the island\u2019s wilderness areas, its quiet relaxed atmosphere, and its unhurried pace. We\u2019ll be staying at an historic lodge on the island.

This nonprofit organization preserves more than 250 acres of woodlands, gardens, and a mile of waterfront. After lunch at the Gardens, we will meet our Registered Maine guides for an instruction session and a two-hour kayak trip on the protected Sheepscot River. No experience is necessary. We will stop at Ram Island in the river for a snack. We may see seals, eagles, ospreys, and harbor seals. Dinner this evening will be at another tasty seafood restaurant--EXPANDFROMHERE--.Day 3: This morning after breakfast we\u2019ll hike on a two-mile trail with quiet coves and salt marshes and another three-mile trail that borders the river. These trails require moderate hiking. The Boothbay Region Land Trust controls these trails as part of their mission to preserve more than 1,700 acres of land, including six islands. \u00a0After a picnic lunch we\u2019ll enjoy a two-hour sail on a historic windjammer. The captain will allow you to take a turn at the wheel, help set sail, or just relax on the cushioned cabin tops as we sail out past a lighthouse to the outer islands of Boothbay. Our treat this evening is a dinner cabaret performed by a local talented cast. \u00a0Day 4: This is our free day to choose any activity you\u2019d like on your own.

Tonight\u2019s dinner will feature lobsters with all the fixings. After dinner, a speaker from the local land trust will give us a presentation about current environmental issues facing the area.Day 5: This morning we take a small ferry from Boothbay Harbor to Monhegan Island. This 1.5-hour ferry ride will give us a view of the quintessentially Maine coast -- a rugged coastline lined with pine and spruce, islands galore, and recreational boaters and lobstermen. Since before John Smith visited it in 1614, Monhegan Island was known to Native Americans as a prime fishing area. Today its year-round population hovers around 65 and is increased by visitors who appreciate its isolation, slow pace, and its reputation as a magnet for artists. After we check into our historic hotel and eat our picnic lunch, we take an orientation walk around the tiny village and then a hike to the rocky shore to climb one of the headlands. We will enjoy dinner at our hotel. After dinner, a local naturalist will talk to us about the natural aspects and history of this unique island.Day 6: After breakfast our naturalist will introduce us to some of the marine life at the shore. After lunch there will be free time to wander around the island on your own, sampling artists\u2019 galleries, hiking, or just looking at the view from the shore. Our farewell dinner will be at one of the restaurants on the island.Day 7: After breakfast at our hotel we\u2019ll take our last hike on the island together.\u00a0We\u2019ll depart on the 2:45 p.m. boat back to Boothbay Harbor,\u00a0arriving at 4:15 p.m.\u00a0We\u2019ll say our goodbyes to our new friends and depart for our homes.

Rwanda, the Land of a Thousand Hills, lives up to its nickname from the high volcanic peaks of the Virunga Range in the west to its swampy plains draining into Lake Victoria in the east. Being situated on the Albertine branch of the Great Rift Valley has given these countries their unique geography of volcanoes and strings of lakes, some as large as inland seas. Though lying on and just south of the equator, this uplift has given them a higher elevation, thus a cool, comfortable climate and an attractive home for their wide variety of wildlife.Uganda and Rwanda are both known for having a troubled past, but that reputation is quickly vanishing as these are two of the three countries where you can still see mountain gorillas. A rare species that was in critical decline in the 1980s, mountain gorillas have been increasing in number since the governments realized that people will pay good money just to spend time in their presence and therefore have set up strict programs for their protection. But this trip is about more than gorillas. Large families of chimpanzees also share these forests along with 13 species of primates, over 1,000 bird species, up to 30,000 hippos, lions, cape buffalo, elephants, Uganda kob, leopards, gazelles, and warthogs. Although there is nothing like the emotional and humbling experience of sitting just feet away from our closest relatives in the animal kingdom, spotting other unique monkeys and surprisingly colorful birds, floating among crocodiles and hippos, and tracking radio-collared research lions are equally as exciting. This trip also gives us a chance to interact with the local people to learn about their culture and how their lives have improved because of the jobs and income this kind of tourism creates. We will spend equal time in both countries to learn their histories and compare and contrast their development.Our adventure begins with arrival in Kampala, the capital of Uganda. With its setting on rolling hills just a few kilometers from Lake Victoria, we'll spend a day touring many interesting sites such as the Gadaffi Mosque in Old Kampala, the Kabaka Palace, the colonial Parliament building, hilltop cathedrals, and local craft shops before heading out into the country. Two full days in Kibale Forest National Park provide us an entire day to track chimpanzees and observe their antics close-up, to identify eight primate species and over 200 bird species in Bigodi Wetlands Sanctuary, and to hike among crater lakes and tea plantations to get a taste of local life. In the savannas and rift valley lakes of Queen Elizabeth National Park, we'll view wildlife on game drives, take a boat safari among hippos, crocodiles, elephants, and cape buffalo, and track radio-collared lions with a research project. As we travel south to the border region with Rwanda, our lakeside resort presents the first romantic views of the volcanic cones of the Virunga Range. The first day of gorilla tracking is in Bwindi Impenetrable Forest National Park where about half the remaining mountain gorillas live -- our first chance to observe these gentle giants. After the two- to five-hour hike to find our designated family, we'll have an entire hour to spend in their presence.Then we say farewell to Uganda and cross the border into Rwanda with an afternoon in the capital city of Kigali. The Genocide Memorial and Education Centre is a dignified tribute to the victims of their violent past; a visit there will help us understand Rwanda's need to never forget what happened while using the lessons learned to move on in a peaceful, united way. Leaving the city, we have another day of chimpanzee tracking at Nyungwe Forest National Park, the largest remaining intact montane rainforest in East Africa. A treasure of biodiversity, it is home to 13 primate species, 500-1,000 chimpanzees, over 1,000 plant species including 200 orchids, 120 butterfly species, and 85 different mammals. Nyungwe is an important, and still undiscovered, birding site boasting 310 bird species, 26 of which are endemic. We drive around and spend a night at massive Lake Kivu, which is the 15th-largest lake in the world and shares the border with the Democratic Republic of the Congo, on the way back up to the Virunga Mountains and Volcanoes National Park. This is our second gorilla tracking opportunity and a chance to observe the same families Dian Fossey studied. Sitting among the silverback, blackbacks, mothers, and babies will feel like we're attending a family gathering. We'll learn about traditional culture at a local village and visit the Dian Fossey gorilla research center before heading back to Kigali, where the trip ends.The focus of this outing is observing wildlife, but we will also witness how Uganda and Rwanda are developing, experience the warmth and charm of their people, and learn how they're combining development with habitat and wildlife protection to encourage tourism and thus promote higher education and raise their standard of living. The mountain gorilla is so important to Rwanda that it's beloved by all its citizens and considered the national symbol. Their philosophy of high-cost low-volume tourism seeks to maximize economic benefits while minimizing impact and habitat loss. Indeed, Uganda and Rwanda are now considered two of the safest countries in Africa, so come connect with our primate ancestry and explore the Pearl of Africa and Land of a Thousand Hills.","highlights":"Observe gorillas & chimps at close range on four days, Enjoy lion tracking and safaris by boat & Land Cruiser, Observe up to 13 primate and 1,000 bird species","includes":"  All permits for gorilla and chimpanzee tracking,   Experienced driver\/guides throughout,   All gratuities, meals, and scenic local accommodations","itinerary":"Even though Uganda and Rwanda have rebuilt and improved their infrastructure, these are still developing countries. We will try to adhere to this itinerary, but you should be flexible and patient about any changes that may have to be made due to circumstances beyond our control.Day 1: Arrival in Kampala, UgandaYou will be met upon arrival at the international airport in Entebbe and driven to our hotel in Kampala, about an hour drive. It's recommended to arrive a day or two early in case of any flight or baggage delays and to recover from jet lag.\u00a0 Extra nights may be reserved at our hotel. Our accommodations are on the edge of the city with views out to Lake Victoria.Day 2: KampalaAwaken to bird song, then after breakfast have an orientation about the trip.\u00a0 Head off for a city tour with our driver\/guides and Land Cruisers we'll be traveling in for the duration of the outing.\u00a0 Kampala is a large, vibrant city with a nighttime population of about 1.8 million, swelling to a daytime population of 4 million as commuters stream into the city for employment.\u00a0 We will need to have patience with the traffic as we travel to various points of interest: the Gadaffi Mosque -- a gift from the Libyan leader to Uganda with a 360-degree view of Kampala from its minaret; the Kabaka's palace, the historic home of the Buganda king; the colonial Parliament building; and for those interested, a brief visit to Idi Amin's torture chambers. Although a sad reminder of Idi Amin's reign of terror, it serves as a lesson in history not to be repeated. Return to our hotel for dinner.Day 3: Kibale Forest National ParkGreet the morning with a glorious sunrise over Lake Victoria, then depart for the 6-hour drive to Kibale Forest Camp.\u00a0 After negotiating the rush-hour traffic to get out of Kampala, head west through villages, corn fields, eucalyptus and pine tree farms, tea plantations on rolling hills, then finally through the jungle of the northern reaches of Kibale National Park. It won't take long to start seeing Uganda's wide variety of birds -- the great blue turaco, marabou storks, wooly-necked storks, long-crested eagles, hamerkops, and egrets are just a few we can see on our drive as our keen-eyed, knowledgeable guides point them out. We will also have field guides available to aid in identification. Lunch en route will be an opportunity to try some traditional Ugandan foods such as matoke, a savory stiff banana mash. At least four species of monkeys and troops of baboons welcome us as we arrive at our forest camp. Our accommodations for three nights are in large, permanent, luxury safari tents where black and white colobus, red colobus, grey-cheeked mangabeys, and red-tailed monkeys can be seen from the veranda. Trilling bird songs and the howls of monkeys can be heard throughout the night.Days 4-5: Chimpanzee Tracking and Bigodi Weltlands Sanctuary To reduce impact on the forest and the chimpanzees and for a more intimate experience, we'll divide into two groups.\u00a0 One group will rise early for an all-day chimpanzee habituation hike while the other group will start a little later for its activities.\u00a0 After a ranger briefing at Kibale National Park headquarters, an experienced ranger-guide leads us for a one- to two-hour hike to find the chimpanzee community. Uganda is home to about 5,000 chimpanzees in the wild and Kibale Forest boasts the highest number of primate species in the world.\u00a0 We may see some of these along the way and hear the whoops and hollers of the chimps long before we reach them as they rise and breakfast from their tree-top nests. We will be with the chimps from early morning when they wake up until early evening when they build their new nests for the night as our specialized ranger explains their habits and social behavior.\u00a0 After they've had their morning meal is when it gets exciting as they typically come down from the trees and allow us to observe at close-range how they interact, feed, play, and groom each other.\u00a0 They may even let us nap with them!\u00a0 The chimpanzee families have been habituated by the rangers for over 20 years to tolerate humans and indeed they pretty much ignore us and thus allow us to be in their family for a day.\u00a0While one group is tracking chimpanzees, the other will go on a morning Crater Lakes hike with two local guides. This hike is outside the national park and gives local guides an opportunity to show off their home area.\u00a0 Beginning through tea plantations, we'll learn the various steps of growing and maturing tea, a big industry in Uganda. The rift zone is pockmarked with crater lakes from past volcanic activity and we'll walk around one of these where fishermen catch tilapia. As we climb up the rolling hills through small, friendly farming villages, we'll see an assortment of birds, including flycatchers, palm nut eagles, black and white vultures, sunbirds, and pelicans until we reach the Top of the World for 360-degree views of the entire area.\u00a0 We return back to camp for a hot lunch and rest before heading to Bigodi Wetland Sanctuary, a preserve protected by a local conservation organization.\u00a0 A guided walk through the boardwalked swamp will yield several monkey species, open-billed storks among other birds, and black-masked and yellow-backed weaver birds building their oddly spherical hanging nests.\u00a0The next day the groups switch their activities.Days 6-7: Queen Elizabeth National ParkWe move on to the savannas of Queen Elizabeth National Park on a back route through lush, scenic hills and local villages, passing myriads of people pushing bicycles top-heavy with bananas to outdoor markets, witnessing a slice of life. This is our lowest and warmest destination at 3,000 feet at the foot of the snow-capped Rwenzori Mountains.\u00a0 Lunch is at our lodge on the Mweya Peninsula in Lake Edward with views to the Kazinga Channel, a 25-mile waterway connecting Lakes Edward and George.\u00a0 We'll be staying here for two nights.\u00a0 Our first game drive is in the afternoon where we're likely to see cape buffalo and elephant, Defassa waterbuck and Uganda kob -- depicted on the Ugandan flag -- as well as hippo, warthog, giant forest hog, lion, and hyena. Birds we may see are the red-throated sunbird, black-headed gonolek, lilac-breasted roller, superb starling, and a variety of weavers among many others.\u00a0The next morning we rise early for a unique opportunity to track radio-collared lions with the Uganda Carnivore Program, a research organization studying the health of lions in Uganda.\u00a0 One of their head researchers rides with us as we're allowed to go off-road to find and observe a research pride up close. We'll learn about the project and find out what has been discovered about lion habits, spread of disease among lions throughout Africa, and the state of Uganda's lion population. In return, we will be donating a radio collar so they may study more lions.\u00a0 In the afternoon we'll have a boat safari on the Kazinga Channel, a highlight of the park. From the safety of our vessel we'll float among as many as 30,000 hippos, watch groups of cape buffalo and elephants on shore who come to the channel to drink, see crocodiles and Nile (like monitor) lizards, and a most colorful array of birds including the red-throated bee-eater, woodland kingfisher, and the stunningly patterned African pied kingfisher. We'll do another game drive on the way back to our lodge.Day 8: Lake MutandaThis is a travel day as we move to lovely Lake Mutanda near the border of Rwanda. On this seven-hour drive we leave the heat of the savanna behind and start climbing into the cool mountains known as the \"Switzerland of Africa.\" As we near the lake we'll start to see the volcanic cones of the Virunga Mountains. Lake Mutanda is studded with many islands and our lodge is situated on a peninsula jutting out into the lake, providing a most romantic view of islands in the foreground with the Virunga Mountains in the back. At 5,000 feet, it's comfortably cool here. From our cabins we can watch weaverbirds build their complex nests to attract mates, beautiful grey crowned cranes -- also depicted on the Ugandan flag -- roosting in trees, as well as eagles, pelicans, and even otters playing onshore. We will stay here two nights, enjoying the wind-chime chirps of tinker frogs in the evenings.Day 9: Gorilla Tracking in Bwindi Impenetrable Forest National ParkToday we have our first gorilla tracking in Bwindi Impenetrable Forest, a remnant of the montane rain forest that used to cover much of Central and East Africa. This is the only forest that both gorillas and chimpanzees inhabit, along with five other primate species, 113 different mammals, over 200 butterfly species, and 360 species of birds. Tracking gorillas is a highly regulated activity -- small groups are allowed to hike with a specialized ranger who has been active in the habituation of nine family groups who can tolerate humans for a brief period every day. The hike to reach the family can take two to five hours over steep, slippery, muddy terrain with some bushwhacking.\u00a0 Local porters are available to hire for a nominal fee (not included) to carry your daypack, but they also help you on the rough parts of the hike. Scouts set out early each morning to find the family groups, and when you reach them you are allowed to take only a camera for the precise one hour of time allowed for direct observation at as close as 20 feet. With typically 12-20 in a family group, you won't know whether to watch the dominant silverback, teenage blackbacks, mothers with their infants, or the antics of the juveniles. The gorillas are naturally curious, and after this breathtaking hour you may not know who was doing the observing and who was being observed! We leave the gorillas in peace as we hike back to our vehicles and return to Lake Mutanda.Day 10: Kigali, RwandaWe say goodbye to Uganda as we cross the border into Rwanda, the land of a thousand hills. After border formalities, we arrive in the capital city of Kigali for lunch.\u00a0 With a population of a million people, it's also built on several hills. We visit the Genocide Memorial and Education Centre in the afternoon to provide a reference and gain an understanding of Rwandan society. Though it sounds depressing, the Centre sympathetically tells the story of the 1994 Rwanda genocide and leaves you with hope of a bright future. Unifying the ethnic groups and bringing people together in activities such as cleaning streets and public places the last Saturday of every month are just a couple examples of how the country is moving on. Our accommodations for the night include a refreshing swimming pool and a variety of birds in its gardens. We return here at the end of the trip.Day 11: Nyungwe Forest National ParkWe drive to the southern edge of the country to Nyungwe Forest National Park, the largest remaining tract of montane rainforest left in East Africa. You can tell immediately when we transition from tea plantations to the mountainous, fog-shrouded, dense forest. Here in this home to all 13 primate species, including 500-1,000 chimpanzees, you can easily see colobus, L'Hoest, and blue monkeys from the road. Nyungwe is a living repository of over 1,000 plant species -- including 200 different orchids, which may be blooming at any time. Its real importance is as an undiscovered birding destination harboring 310 bird species, 26 of which occur nowhere else. After lunch, at a park visitor center where L'Hoest monkeys roam freely, a late afternoon arrival brings us to our cottages set on a low hill with views out to expansive Lake Kivu. We stay here for two nights.Day 12: Chimpanzee Tracking at NyungweThis is our second day of tracking chimpanzees. A very early morning start and about an hour drive gets us to the starting point, where we meet our ranger-guide and porters to carry our packs. This is necessary as they not only carry our packs, but take us by the hand to help on the very steep, slippery bushwhacking to find the chimp community. It may take up to two hours to find them, then we have the morning to observe their routine. While hiking through the dense jungle, we may see other monkeys and a wide variety of birds and plants.\u00a0 Returning to our lodge for lunch, we have the opportunity afterward for a beautiful jungle waterfall hike -- this time on well-groomed trail with a knowledgeable guide to identify the flowers, birds, monkeys, and reptiles we'll see. The destination is a tall, voluminous waterfall in a lush, tropical setting.Day 13: Lake KivuDescend the mountains for the scenic drive around Lake Kivu, which lies along Rwanda's western border with the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Lake Kivu is one of the large Albertine Rift lakes and is the 15th-largest freshwater lake in the world. This massive lake has surprisingly few fish species because of a huge naturally occurring methane bubble that Rwanda is generating power from. Our African-style lodging for the night is about halfway along the lake in the provincial capital of Kibuye, set along an inlet with charming views over the lake, where you can see fisherman taking out traditional long boats with gracefully arched outriggers extending over the sides.\u00a0 After lunch we'll have a three-island boat tour, including appropriately named Bat Island. The beautifully landscaped grounds and flowering trees of our lodge attract a colorful array of birds including double-toothed barbets, black-winged red bishops, robin chats, and iridescent sunbirds.Day 14: Volcanoes National ParkWe continue north along the lake, then start climbing up into the mountains of the Virunga Range. You can see one volcanic cone-shaped peak after another rising to nearly 15,000 feet as they trap moist, tropical air to create a cool, damp climate. Our lodge sits on a slope just outside Volcanoes National Park at 7,500 feet, which we'll reach for lunch.\u00a0 We stay at these charming, stone cabins surrounded by eucalyptus trees for two nights.\u00a0 In the afternoon we'll visit a replica of a traditional Rwandan village. This is a stage for the local villagers to show off different aspects of their culture.\u00a0 In several thatched huts we can see demonstrations of activities such as blacksmithing, grinding grain, churning butter, making banana beer, and use of medicinal plants, topped off with a program of traditional dancing and drumming in native dress. In this way, the benefits of tourism are shared by the local communities providing employment for ex-poachers, relieving stress on resources around the park, and raising funds to help farmers buy seeds and provide scholarships and school supplies for children.Day 15: Gorilla Tracking in Volcanoes National ParkWe rise early for our second day of gorilla tracking. After an initial briefing by the rangers, we'll once again be divided into two groups to visit two different gorilla families. The nine habituated gorilla groups are spread throughout the park, so the strength and abilities of the human groups will try to be matched with the difficulty of reaching the designated gorilla family. This could entail a rough, rugged hike of two to four hours with as much as 1,000 feet of elevation gain through dense, slippery bamboo forest to find our families. Our altitude could be over 9,000 feet, making the ascent feel even more strenuous, but there will be porters available to carry daypacks and assist on the hike. Once the gorillas are found, we have that magical hour in their presence to observe, photograph, and even video their behaviors. The trackers, usually ex-poachers who have searched for the groups ahead of time, enjoy taking that memorable photo of you in front of the gorillas.Day 16: Return to KigaliEarly departure to get back on the road to Kigali, but first we make a stop to visit Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International in Musanze, a research organization originally created by Dian and carrying on her work. Their headquarters and visitor center tell Dian's story, while exhibits creatively show the mountainous landscape and how the gorilla families move throughout it. From there it takes about two hours to get back to Kigali, where we'll have a chance to shop for locally made crafts before being dropped off at our lodge. We say good-bye to our driver\/guides, who have not only done a fabulous job of driving us around, but have given us lots of information about each place we've visited, identified birds and wildlife for us, and made all our arrangements go smoothly. The afternoon is free for packing, swimming, or exploring around the hotel.Day 17: Departure HomeBreakfast is our last trip meal before departure to the airport provided by the hotel. Leaving Rwanda and Uganda is bittersweet, but we\u2019re comforted by fond memories of all we've seen and done.","leader1":"Melinda Goodwater","leader2":"Shlomo Waser","leader3":""}},{"trip":{"title":"Magnificent Maroon Bells, Colorado","id":"18130A","dates":"Sep 21, 2018 to Sep 28, 2018","destination":"United States, Colorado","type":"Backpack","group":"","difficulty":"4 (out of 5)","priceHigh":"1245","priceLow":"1245","image":{"src":"https:\/\/content.sierraclub.org\/outings\/sites\/content.sierraclub.org.outings\/files\/styles\/trip-teaser\/public\/trips\/main-images\/header_02.jpg?itok=PCGfUaxQ","alt":""},"path":"\/outings\/national\/brochure\/magnificent-maroon-bells-colorado#trip=18130A","overview":"The Trip\"I think the best inspired painter that ever drew would fail in attempting to describe these mighty mountains.

The work of maintaining and restoring the old buildings and grounds will continue to be the focus of our work in years to come.However, the week will not be all work and no play. To begin with, we will be housed in rustic cabins in the woods at the Shepherd's Spring Outdoor Ministry Center, which is located just 1.5 hours west of Washington, D.C. The cabins are centered around a large beautiful pavilion with a fireplace and an unending supply of firewood. The center is situated on 220 acres of rolling, wooded land along the Chesapeake & Ohio (C&O) Canal Towpath, which follows the winding Potomac River.Just a few miles from the retreat center is the Antietam National Battlefield, which commemorates a fierce battle between Union and Confederate soldiers--EXPANDFROMHERE--. On these 12 square miles was the bloodiest day of the Civil War, September 17, 1862. During this single day, more than 23,000 men were killed, wounded, or missing, with neither side able to declare a decisive victory. This battlefield will be our work site.Less than 10 miles south of Antietam is Harpers Ferry National Historical Park. Probably best-known from our years-ago history classes is the story of abolitionist John Brown's raid on the United States Armory and Arsenal in October 1859. His attempt to arm an uprising of slaves ended with his capture and conviction for \"conspiring with slaves to commit treason and murder.\" Despite Brown's failure to arm the slaves, his trial and execution served to focus the nation's attention on the moral issue of slavery and led the country toward Civil War.\u00a0The ProjectAs with all of our national parks, refuges, and forests, the Antietam National Battlefield is always in need of more work to maintain its grounds and structures than park staff alone could ever complete. Over the years, our \u00a0trips have focused on restoration work: building and repairing fences and gates, constructing a workshop in the corn crib at the Poffenberger Farm, cleaning and painting historic buildings, whitewashing structures, working to restore a 1700s log cabin, cleaning and sealing the wood coping on the Burnside Bridge, and painting cannons.\u00a0We will work with the Battlefield staff. Not only are they trying to maintain the historic structures at Antietam, they are also trying to restore the landscape to better reflect the way it would have looked at the time of the battle. We will let the staff determine their greatest needs -- as always, Sierra Club volunteers are willing and able to do what is necessary. However, based on recent experience, it is likely that we will be involved in landscape restoration activities (such as building, repairing, or painting fences and planting historic plant species) and in painting or whitewashing the interior or exterior of the historic buildings.\u00a0","highlights":"Help restore and maintain the battlefield, Learn Civil War history from park rangers, Tour the battlefield with a professional guide","includes":"  Lodging in woodland cabins with bunk beds,   Buffet-style meals (vegetarian options available),   Guest speaker fees","itinerary":"Day 1: We will gather at 4 p.m. for introductions, orientation, and settling into our cabins before dinner at 6 p.m. We will go over our week's schedule and the possibilities of after-work and day-off activities.

They came down from inland Maine to fish and hunt. The Wabanaki Indians called Mount Desert Island Pemetic, or \u201cthe sloping land.\u201d Samuel Champlain \u201cdiscovered\u201d Mount Desert Island in 1604, sailing into Frenchman Bay. Champlain is responsible for the current name of the island. After observing the bald and rocky mountain summits, he named it Isles des Monts Desert (Island of Bald Mountains). In 1759, the British defeated the French in the French and Indian war, opening the Maine coast to English settlement--EXPANDFROMHERE--. Around this same time, the Governor of Massachusetts tried to lay claim to the area by offering free land to European settlers. That is how a man by the name of Abraham Somes came to move there. He settled his family in what is now known as Somesville. Artists arrived in the late 1840s and, because of their paintings of the area, it became a popular summer colony for the wealthy around the turn of this century. Gifts of land and money from these early seasonal residents made Acadia National Park possible. Today, the park encompasses more than 47,000 acres of ocean coastline, forests, meadows, lakes, and mountains.The paradise that first attracted the Wabanaki tribe remains today. An extensive system of rugged, and sometimes challenging, foot trails will lead the hiker up any of the 20+ bare-topped \u201cmountains,\u201d all of which stand at altitudes of less than 1,600 feet. At the top, hikers are rewarded with incredible views of the surrounding islands, valley lakes, Frenchman Bay, and the Atlantic Ocean. Additionally, there is an abundance of flora and fauna at Acadia, with approximately 165 species of native plants, 60 species of mammals, and more than 150 species of breeding birds.Another impressive feature of Acadia is the park\u2019s 45-mile network of carriage roads designed and constructed by John D. Rockefeller, Jr. between 1913 and 1940. Many of the roads were built on his land, which he later donated to the government; others were built on government land or on land owned by private conservation organizations. The carriage road network is linked by 17 remarkable granite bridges spanning streams, waterfalls, cliffs, and roads. These roads are used exclusively for mountain biking, hiking, jogging, and horseback riding. No other comparable road system exists in America\u2019s national parks.On our off day, we will be free to explore the park and the island. Acadia National Park and Mt. Desert Island abound with opportunities to hike, bike, sightsee, and explore. In addition, there are numerous picturesque villages to see, museums and galleries to visit, as well as places to shop at in Bar Harbor and other nearby island towns. Visitors can take advantage of the free, propane-powered Island Explorer buses (http:\/\/www.exploreacadia.com\/), which deliver passengers to all points of interest, including major trailheads.The ProjectThree million people visit Acadia National Park each year. As you can imagine, there is much maintenance required to keep the park in good shape. Our group will be open to completing whatever work project(s) park personnel deem most appropriate during our four work days. Projects could include restoring the carriage roads, clearing culverts, installing log checks, bench cutting, or helping to control non-native, invasive flora, just to name a few. The work may be ordinary or it may be special. For several years, Sierra Club volunteers had participated in the park\u2019s ongoing effort to rebuild the 100+ year-old retaining walls lining the carriage roads. These turned out to be very special projects that participants found rewarding and highly memorable. Please be advised that we are oftentimes asked to remove tree roots from trails in order to improve the integrity of the trail.\u00a0 Such roots may or may not be attached to living trees.

At the Kapoho Tidepools we\u2019ll soak, swim, and snorkel among coral and colorful fish in exceptionally clear water. These pools are officially part of the Marine Life Conservation District. The Kapoho Tidepools are made of interconnecting ancient lava flows that have created tidepools extending as far as 200 yards off shore. There is excellent visibility in the water, which offers exceptional opportunities for taking underwater photos. Scanning the waters we\u2019ll see a variety of coral, fish, and sometimes sea turtles. Relaxing in these naturally warmed tidepools with views of palm trees and open ocean is the best. Down the road is the Ahalanui Park. \u00a0This park was designed around the Ahalanui warm pond that is naturally heated by volcanic energy (a lovely 91-95 degrees).

Leaving the market, we will drive to Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park and spend the rest of the day there. Some of the best hiking on the island is in the National Park, so we will hike a sampling of those trails. Our options for the day include Kilauea Iki (a 3-mile loop), Pu'u Loa Petroglyph Trail (a 1.5-mile loop) and the Thurston Lava Tube (less than 1 mile). After hiking, we will head home for a relaxing dinner. After dinner, we will head to Puna District for the night farmers' market at Uncle Robert\u2019s. (Uncle Robert Keli'iho'omalu is the legendary and beloved patriarch of the old Kalapana Village. His family compound is where the market is located.)

Our first stop will be at the Hawai'i Tropical Botanical Garden where we will wander through the gardens to see as many as 2,500 exotic types of marked tropical flora. Birds abound in this exceptional rain forest habitat, so binoculars are a good idea. We will visit the 420-foot 'Akaka Falls, Laupahoehoe Point, and the town of Honoka'a. Beyond Honoka'a, the road ends at the Waipi'o Valley Overlook. Here we see the lush tropical forests and the breathtaking views of the Waipi'o Valley, known as \u201cThe Valley of the Kings.\" Rich in cultural and historic significance, the valley was once populated by thousands of Native Hawaiians. We may hike the steep valley trail there that leads to a remote beach. Returning to Hilo, we will have dinner and relax around the house.Day 6: Our goal today is to get into the sky that surrounds Hawai'i. We will start at the 'Imiloa Astronomy Center in Hilo. Later we will drive up Mauna Kea mountain to the Onizuka Center for International Astronomy Visitor Center (Ellison Onizuka was a native of Kona and a crew member on the Space Shuttle Challenger in 1986). We will want to bring warm clothes for the 9,200-foot elevation on Mauna Kea as it can be cool up there. Once we acclimate to the elevation, we can take a short trail to Sunset Hill. On top of the 13,803-foot Mauna Kea (which means \"white mountain\") are 13 observatories owned by different countries and institutions. Together, the observatories make Mauna Kea the most scientifically productive site for astronomy worldwide. We plan to visit the top of Mauna Kea unless road conditions prevent us from going there. After dinner, we will return to 'Imiloa Astronomy Center for the Friday evening planetarium show.Day 7: Sadly, it is our last full day together. To continue making those Hawaiian-warm memories, we will spend our time on the Kohola Coast, the northeast portion of Hawai'i. We are headed to the white sand beaches of the Big Island to relax, bask in the sun, and swim. Our choices include Hapuna Beach, Mauna Kea Beach, Kiholo Bay, and Pololu Beach (located near Hawi on the north end of the island).

Free evening -- excludes dinner. Lodging in Naples.Day 3:\u00a0(Vesuvius and Pompeii) No visit to Southern Italy would be complete without a visit to Mount Vesuvius and Pompeii. We will start the day with a refreshing hike up the ash maker itself, Mount Vesuvius. A volcanologist will teach us about his trade as we hike up and around the black sand that encircles the crater. Along the way, we will also learn how the legends of Vesuvius dominate local folklore. After lunch, we will make our way to Pompeii, the ancient Roman settlement that was destroyed in A.D. 79 by the explosion of Mt. Vesuvius and remained covered in thick protective ash until its excavation began at the end of the 1700s. Lodging in Massa Lubrense for two nights.Day 4:\u00a0(Capri) This morning we will enjoy a short cruise to the fabled island of Capri, where we will drive up the unforgettably winding road to Anacapri, a picturesque town of 5,000 that somehow clings to the mountainside. A short walk brings us to Migliara, where we enjoy a view of the Punta Carena lighthouse and neighboring Ischia and Procida islands. Those who want to hike farther can climb to Capri\u2019s highest point, Monte Solaro (1,926 feet above sea level). But don\u2019t worry; there is a chairlift option as well (fee additional)! After enjoying this world-class view, we will return to Anacapri with its fascinating boutiques to enjoy free time and lunch.

We will tour Villa Cimbrone, an original 19th-century estate, which boasts lifelike statues, the viewpoint \"Belvedere of Infinity,\" and exquisite gardens that hang over the sea. We will then depart on foot along an ancient mule path to the tiny village of Pontone, ending our walk in Amalfi, with time to enjoy a gelato or tour the Catedrale di Sant\u2019 Andrea, which is a combination of Sicilian, Arabic, and Norman architecture on the outside and pure baroque on the inside. Lodging in Paestum for two nights.Day 6:\u00a0(Paestum and Agropoli) This morning we will tour the Greco-Roman city of Paestum. Here, the ancient temple of Hera, built in 550 B.C., has been painstakingly restored and preserved through the ages. In the museum, we will view unique frescoes depicted on tomb slabs that date to the 5th century B.C. -- including the world-famous \"Tomb of the Diver.\u201d In the afternoon, time permitting, we will visit Agropoli and its imposing Angevin-Aragonese castle. Lodging in Paestum.Day 7:\u00a0(Matera) Today we will reach the lesser-known, but incredibly beautiful, Basilicata region. In the recent past, this was one of the poorest areas in Italy, but it's also one of the most beautiful. Its Middle Eastern appearance secured it as the setting for Mel Gibson\u2019s movie \u201cThe Passion\u201d and many other biblical-era productions. Its capital city of Matera will surely be one of the highlights of our journey. The labyrinthine streets combine ancient stone structures with buildings of later eras -\u2013 a fascinating blend of old and new, which will take your breath away...especially at sunset. We can tour one of the cave homes furnished exactly as it was before the government moved the people out in the 1950s. The UNESCO World Heritage central city is being redone artistically, all while keeping the historic architecture of the buildings. At dusk, when the city's white stone turns to pink, a quiet walk on its cobblestone streets will take you back in time. Lodging in Matera for two nights.Day 8:\u00a0(Matera) Today we will hike into Parco Regionale delle Chiese Rupestri, \u201cPark of the Rock Churches.\u201d Once home to ancient civilizations, this area today is a nature sanctuary that provides protection to numerous plant species. Our trail leads us through deep gorges with prehistoric caves. We will also visit the incredible Crypt of the Original Sin, a fresco that was painted with astonishing colors and techniques 1,300 years ago.

After a demonstration of how these trulli were built, we will walk on an ancient farmer\u2019s path along sturdy stone walls through olive trees and an abundance of oak, cork, and carob trees. We will then take a tour of the UNESCO World Heritage village of Alberobello -- very picturesque with all of its Trulli -- and get settled in our special hotel for the next two nights. This is our opportunity to learn to cook a southern Italian meal. Buon appetito! Lodging near Alberobello for two nights.Day 10:\u00a0(Ostuni) Known for its whitewashed walls, Ostuni overlooks the Adriatic and features a dramatic 15th-century cathedral in its medieval center.

Lodging near Alberobello.Day 11:\u00a0(Lecce) We will enjoy an unforgettable olive oil tasting on our way to Lecce, the Florence of the south. It is a baroque town full of surprises -- a church dizzyingly decorated with asparagus column tops, decorative dodos, and cavorting gremlins -- inspiring someone to say the fa\u00e7ade made him think a lunatic was having a nightmare. We will observe the Spanish influence as we tour the world-famous Church of the Holy Cross and then continue to visit the monuments and buildings that make Lecce one of the most appealing cities in Italy. An outdoor veranda near the main square is the location for a delicious luncheon of many varieties of antipasti. Free evening - excludes dinner.\u00a0 Lodging near Lecce for two nights.Day 12:\u00a0(Lecce and Otranto) This morning we will make our way to Otranto on the Adriatic coast. Otranto is a lovely city with a small harbor, a castle, an incredibly well- preserved medieval city center, and a beautiful cathedral that hosts one of the most famous mosaic floors of the South, depicting a stupendous Tree of Life. Tonight we will return to Lecce, where we will feast on a farewell dinner of local specialties.

Launching from Crystal Geyser just above a colorful canyon, we begin to meander peacefully downstream to the rhythm of dipping paddle strokes and settle into river time. The canyon grows deeper with every twist of the river as cliff walls rise sharply from the river\u2019s edge, displaying a rainbow of colors with the changing light of the day. Listen quietly and you will begin to hear the sounds of the desert, the soft wind in a cottonwood tree, the shriek of a peregrine falcon or the rumble of rock as a Desert Bighorn sheep comes down to the river at dusk. In the cool morning air, we\u2019ll hike up narrow side canyons to eerie panels of 800-year-old Indian rock art, which tell a story we do not fully understand. Our 60-mile guided paddle is considered the premier calm water canoe trip in the Southwest--EXPANDFROMHERE--.During this multi-activity adventure, we\u2019ll explore by canoe and trail the remote 1,500-foot depths of Labyrinth Canyons below the town of Green River, Utah until our takeout at Mineral Bottom. Several side canyons are geologically and scenically unique and reveal oasis-like microhabitats with spring-fed creeks that are a lush reprieve from the prickly pear cactus environment. Large cottonwood and box elder trees provide shade for humans and wildlife. There is adequate time for hikes through several of these wild side canyons. Then we\u2019ll jump back in the canoes and glide past red tail hawks, great blue herons, lizards, and stately mule deer. Scenic undeveloped campsites are abundant and accessible only by boat. \u00a0On the water we\u2019ll paddle past the vertical cliffs of the Carmel, Navajo, Wingate, and Monenkopi rock formations. These are some of the famous rock layers found in nearby Canyonlands and Arches national parks. The walls will light up with a distinct glow at sunset, often preceded by a brief afternoon thunderstorm and rainbow. This is a very remote desert wilderness with few man-made intrusions. The days are warm, so swims are a welcome addition to the day\u2019s activities.Ancient Fremont and more recently Ute Indians lived in these canyons as evidenced by cliff dwellings, rock art, and granaries. Almost every major side canyon along the river has Indian rock art, chipped petroglyphs, and painted pictographs. Bizarre anthropomorphs, desert animals, and daily life are portrayed on the stone. You\u2019ll also be following in the paddle strokes of Dennis Julian, a fur trapper who traveled the river by canoe and left his signatures in 1836.\u00a0 He was followed later by Major John Wesley Powell in 1869 whose expedition rowed heavy oak boats, recorded detailed scientific information, and named many of the prominent landscape features. During this outing, a special emphasis is placed on learning about the area\u2019s Indian culture, history, and stunning natural resources.Labyrinth Canyon has a mellow current and minor riffles, and no major rapids (rated Class II). Our two-person canoes should be able to pass through the canyons without great difficulty, but you\u2019ll need to paddle through the flat water sections. This makes it an ideal trip for persons who are active outdoors and experienced campers, but who may have little or no previous canoeing experience. More experienced canoeists will enjoy rhythmic paddling, the spectacular scenery, and the stories told by our expert guides. Participants will share a canoe with another person, help to carry group gear in their canoe, and assist in loading and unloading group equipment at camp. This is a shared experience.Camping is done on large sandbars or at the mouth of side canyons. Hikes are usually available at every camp.\u00a0 It is hot in the afternoon, with highs in the upper 80s and cooler in the morning with low temperatures in the 50s. We\u2019ll float in the river often to cool off and drink lots of provided water to stay hydrated. We follow Leave No Trace guidelines for desert river corridors to minimize our impact on this fragile environment, including using chemical toilets for solid human waste. There will be no plumbed or pit toilets available on the river. Sun protection is also very important. A complete checklist of what to bring will be provided by your leader upon acceptance. All meals are included from lunch on day one to lunch on day five.\u00a0 Every meal has fresh ingredients and ample quantities.During this shoulder season, we avoid the extreme heat of mid-summer without sacrificing warm weather and water. It's possible to have summer-like sun or cool fall days; rain, sometimes heavy; and ghostly morning fog. Do not make plans to leave the area on the last day of the trip in case we are delayed. Instead, join the group for a no-host celebration dinner after we get back to the town of Moab, Utah.Sights to see before or after the river trip:Visit the bizarre rock formations in Goblin Valley State Park outside Green RiverHike the trails of Arches National ParkView the fossils at the Cleveland Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry outside Price, UTExplore Nine Mile Canyon Archaeological PreserveCool off in high alpine meadows of the Highway 31 Energy Loop Nat\u2019l Scenic Byway","highlights":"Canoe slickrock desert canyons and hike side canyons, View ancient Indian rock art and pioneer history sites, Observe bighorn sheep and other desert wildlife","includes":"  Two-person canoes, canoeing gear, and most meals,   Licensed professional guides,   Information on natural history and Indian cultures","itinerary":"Pre-Trip:\u00a0Plan to arrive no later than mid-to-late afternoon Sunday.

We will receive a safety orientation, basic paddling instruction for those who wish, and a demonstration on the best way to load our canoes. Then we\u2019re off on our 60-mile descent downriver. A stop for lunch on a pretty beach will be next, then on to camp by 2-4 p.m. Canoes will be unloaded as a group activity, and everyone can set up their tents while the guides assemble the kitchen and begin dinner preparations.Days 2-4: After eating a hearty breakfast and breaking down camp, we begin our first full day on the river. Depending on the campsite, we may begin with a hike to explore a side canyon or complete loading the canoes and paddling downstream. The San Rafael River flows into the Green, giving us more water and the opportunity to paddle through a confluence. \u00a0As the river cuts deeper into the rock formations, the walls rise above us, revealing the multitude of layers and colors of stone laid down millions of years ago. We will stop at the Trin Alcove -- made up of three lovely slot canyons that intersect at the river with great hiking possibilities -- and continue on into Labyrinth Canyon. Highlights include Bowknot Bend (where the river makes a complete loop coming back to a point only a few hundred yards from where it passed some seven miles upstream), Hell Roaring Canyon, and Horseshoe Canyon. Ancestral Puebloan (Anasazi) rock art called petroglyphs are seen in several areas, and granaries are common along the canyon walls. \u00a0Historic sites include the outlaw cabin supposedly used by Butch and Sundance in their horse thieving days, and Register Rock, where explorers and trappers left inscriptions dating as far back as 1836. There will be plenty of hiking opportunities, including from our campsites.Day 5: Our final day on the river will pass through more spectacular scenery as we come to the take-out at Mineral Bottom after lunch. Gear will be transferred from canoes to trailers and then we begin the 900-foot ascent up the Horsethief Trail in our shuttle vehicles. This is a very steep and precarious-switchbacked one-lane dirt road, 1.5 miles long, where we can take one last look at the river from the top. We should be back in Moab before 5 p.m. NOTE: If there has been heavy rain, Mineral Bottom road becomes impassable for shuttle vehicles and the end of our trip will be somewhat delayed.Tipping: Tips are not included in the trip price.

Surrounded by the deep-blue waters of the Aegean Sea, they are the birthplace of the Cycladic civilization present in 3000-1000 BCE. They are best known for their white-washed villages, labyrinths of narrow cobbled streets, tiny countless churches, and deserted windmills. Ancient hiking paths are found connecting historic sites and remote villages. Compared to other Greek islands, they are less visited and retain their own character and traditional customs.Tinos is the first island that we will visit -- locally called the island of Megalohari (the Virgin Mary). Pilgrims, begging for forgiveness of Megalohari, make a pilgrimage by climbing up the hill to the cathedral on their hands and knees. Unique, ancient dovecots are found all through the countryside as are marble bell towers, fountains and statues. From here, we take the ferry to Naxos, the largest and most fertile island, full of Aegean temples, Venetian fortified towers, vineyards and olive groves. It has been inhabited for over 5,000 years, invaded several times and boasts the highest mountain in the Cyclades, Mt. Zas. Amorgos with its golden beaches and crystal clear waters, is our final island destination. Its spectacular scenery, breathtaking cliffs, and cobbled mule paths make it a wonderful hiking destination. This is also the location of the Byzantine Monastery of Chozoviotissa built in 1088 and precipitously perched in a cliff face overlooking the Aegean Sea.We will travel inter-island by large ferry boats or smaller faster boats, depending on the island. Our hotels are locally owned and we will be made very welcome by these wonderful, friendly people. At the end of the trip, we will return to the bustle of Athens and spend our last full day together exploring the ancient areas of the city, including the Acropolis and Parthenon.","highlights":"Hike and explore three of the Cyclades islands, Climb Mt.

The eastern portion of the highlands is within the Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians, where long, steep-sided, forested mountain ridges alternate with broad, flat valleys. Tributaries of the Potomac River have cut deep gaps through the ridges. The western portion is within the\u00a0Allegheny Plateau, a highland that has been significantly eroded by the tributaries of the Ohio River. On the plateau\u2019s eastern edge are the Allegheny Mountains, which rise abruptly along a steep escarpment called the Allegheny Front. The Front is a remarkable geologic boundary between the Appalachians to the east and the Allegheny Plateau to the west--EXPANDFROMHERE--. It closely parallels the eastern Continental Divide, which divides the watershed of the rivers flowing into the Gulf of Mexico from the watershed of the rivers flowing into the Atlantic Ocean. Our mostly moderate to moderately difficult hikes will be in scenic natural areas along the Allegheny Front.The Potomac Highlands are characterized by mountains, plateaus, steep valleys, narrow gorges, and forests. In the broader valleys and on the more gentle slopes are farms on which grain is grown and cattle and sheep are raised. To the north is Canaan Valley, a highland valley with extensive wetlands, and Blackwater Canyon, a rugged, heavily wooded, eight-mile-long gorge carved by the Blackwater River. Agriculture and lumber are important industries, but the area is most notable for its scenery and outdoor recreation -- hiking, backpacking, mountain biking, kayaking, canoeing, skiing (cross-country and downhill), hunting, and fishing.The area was once covered with ancient red spruce and hemlock forests interspersed with open, grassy fields at higher elevations and mixed-hardwood forests at lower elevations. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the forests were cut. With no protective tree cover, the ground became very dry. Sparks from locomotives, sawmills, and fires ignited the slash loggers left behind. Fires repeatedly ravaged the area, scorching the ground down to rock.In 1915, the federal government began purchasing land and in 1920, Monongahela National Forest (MNF) was created to mitigate damage done by clear-cutting the trees in the area. In 1923, the predecessor to Allegheny Power Systems bought 13,230 acres in the northern half of Canaan Valley for the future construction of a hydroelectric power plant. From the 1930s through the 1950s, the state of West Virginia obtained control of 934 acres at the head of Blackwater Canyon from the power company for the development of Blackwater Falls State Park.In 1970, when Allegheny Power requested governmental permits for development of a hydroelectric plant, there was much public opposition. Allegheny\u2019s plan involved damming the Blackwater River and flooding approximately 8,000 acres, about 25% of Canaan Valley. The project was denied a Clean Water Act permit based on the project\u2019s adverse impact upon wetlands, a relatively new concept at the time.In 1994, about 86 acres in the valley were purchased by the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service to establish Canaan Valley National Wildlife Refuge. In 2002, Allegheny -- having kept development of most of Canaan Valley at bay since its 1923 land purchase -- sold most of its property, which was added to the refuge.Large portions of the Potomac Highlands are managed wild areas in Monongahela National Forest (919,000 acres), Canaan Valley National Wildlife Refuge (16,550 acres), Blackwater Falls State Park (2,358 acres), and other parks and preserves.","highlights":"Hike wild and scenic Dolly Sods, See mountain vistas, deep canyons, and waterfalls, Stay in cabins on the rim of a deep canyon","includes":"  All meals except one restaurant meal,   Lodging in modern cabins","itinerary":"Each day will begin with us eating breakfast together and packing our lunches.

On most days the round-trip distance between the cabins and the trailhead will be between 20 and 50 miles. On one day we will explore the area by car and take short hikes. The round-trip distance will be around 120 miles. The hiking itinerary may change due to participants\u2019 abilities and interests, and weather and road conditions. At some point during the week, a local naturalist will talk with us about a topic of local interest.Day 1:\u00a0Arrive at cabins by 4:00 pm.

Located on the former Fort Ord military base, this new national monument -- designated by President Obama on April 20, 2012 -- hosts 35 species of rare plants and animals along with their native coastal habitats, which are protected by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM).While a former military base sounds like an odd choice for a Sierra Club trip, many are surprised by the sheer volume of undeveloped land found on installations such as Fort Ord. BLM\u2019s mission for the area involves providing both habitat preservation and high-quality, environmentally sensitive recreation opportunities. The roads and trails crossing this landscape of rare Central Coast maritime chaparral and vernal pools are used by a multitude of hikers, runners, bicyclists, and equestrians--EXPANDFROMHERE--.The historical significance of these lands far predates the U.S. military\u2019s presence from 1917 to 1994, when Fort Ord was a major training facility for the army from World War II through Desert Storm. Centuries earlier, the Spanish explorer Juan Batista de Anza forged an overland route from Mexico to San Francisco Bay that passed through what is now Fort Ord National Monument.More than a million service people passed through Fort Ord when it was an active military base. We particularly welcome to the trip those who spent time at Fort Ord when it was an active base. Hearing their recollections was a compelling aspect of the inaugural trip in 2012. (See also the Sierra Club's Military Families and Veterans Initiative.)The maritime climate of Monterey keeps the region at moderate temperatures. Fall, however, is the most glorious time of year in the region -- between the summer fog and winter rains -- and the weather is usually pleasantly warm (not too hot) and sunny, with cool evenings.\u00a0The ProjectWe will spend four days working with BLM personnel at Fort\u00a0Ord\u00a0National Monument. Our work will be varied and will depend on the needs of the agency when we are there.\u00a0Possibilities are oak and habitat restoration, native plant landscaping, invasive plant removal, native seed collection, monitoring effects of goat grazing, and even some trail maintenance. Part of the group will also spend one day working at the campsite, which has been set aside for use as a Monterey County Parks property, and after breakfast on Saturday we will undertake removal of the invasive ice plant that is pervasive there.","highlights":"Work with Ft Ord botanists on essential restoration, Explore a hidden gem next to the Monterey Peninsula, Enjoy local produce in delectable vegetarian meals","includes":"  All work tools and instruction,   A drive to campsite that is exclusive and restricted,   Many hiking and cultural opportunities on day off","itinerary":"We will assemble at the campsite adjacent to the National Monument for lunch on Sunday.

Slight schedule changes, therefore, may be needed if specific dates are unavailable.Day 1: After getting to know each other and distributing group commissary, we'll begin our trip in the morning with a drive over back roads to Monument Point, the trailhead for our hike. The drive will take about two hours. We'll spend our first night on the Esplanade, about 2.5 hours (or roughly 3.5 miles) from the trailhead. We will start at 7,400 feet and camp at 5,500, descending about 2,000 feet. It will be a dry camp with no water, so you'll need to bring extra water for dinner as well as to supply a cache for our last night.

Our packs will be heavy to start, but it\u2019s only for a few downhill miles (just in the Grand Canyon!).\u00a0We will camp in the same place for our last night. It is a spectacular spot!Day 2: We will hike along the Esplanade another two to three miles, and then descend steeply another 1,500 feet into Surprise Valley. The descent into the Valley is a steep trail with numerous short switchbacks. It is in the full sun, but we will be hiking it in the early morning. Once in Surprise Valley, we'll hike eastward along rolling hills for two miles; then, we start our descent into Tapeats Canyon. Shortly after starting our descent, we will be able to obtain good water from Thunder River. Another two miles and 1,500 feet along a pretty good trail will get us to our camp at Upper Tapeats (about 2,500 feet) by early afternoon, allowing time to hike and explore the beautiful Tapeats Gorge.Day 3: We have two options on this morning, the low route or the high route. The water level and flow rate of Tapeats Creek will determine our choice. Heavy rains will most likely make the low route unsafe to cross, in which case we\u2019ll have to take the high route. Both are beautiful. The high route has more exposure and is mentally more challenging. The low route will take us across Tapeats creek, as we follow it on roughly level ground for about two miles. We\u2019ll lunch in the shade of cottonwoods and enjoy the cold, crystal-clear water pools of Tapeats Creek. There will be time for a much-needed cold bath if desired. We will then travel on to Lower Tapeats, walking along the sheer walls of Tapeats Gorge with very impressive exposure. We will then descend steeply to our campsite, situated at the water's edge on the Colorado River. The high route keeps us on the west side of Tapeats Creek and gives us a bird\u2019s-eye view of what we could be hiking. Eventually these two trails meet, and the last part of the hike takes us along the same sheer walls of Tapeats Creek.Day 4: The next morning we'll hike west along the beach, picking up a trail that will take us to Deer Creek. It is a rough trail with a few steep ups and downs. It is about five miles to Deer Creek Camp, which sits among some cottonwood trees. We'll arrive by mid afternoon, which will allow time to explore Deer Creek Narrows. (Showers, anyone?)Day 5: This is a layover day. Those who wish to stay in camp can relax in the shade of our cottonwood friends, or just kick back and enjoy the peace and solitude in Deer Creek Narrows, hike up to the Throne room, Deer Creek Spring and down to the base of Deer Creek Falls at the Colorado River.Day 6: This day will present us with our most challenging hiking. We'll ascend the west side of Deer Creek Valley, which is shady in the early morning, to Surprise Valley -- 1,500 feet of elevation gain in about two miles. Once we get to Surprise, we will be in the full sun. We'll hike east a couple of miles in Surprise Valley until we get to the ascent to the Esplanade. This is the same descent we did into Surprise our second day out. We will be ascending a south-facing slope in the full sun to the Esplanade (about 1,500 feet up). Once we get up to the Esplanade, we'll make our way to our first camp and our water cache. We'll use the two quarts of each person's cached water for cooking our dinner and breakfast the next morning. There is plenty of shade here, and we'll be at 5,500 feet, so it will be cooler. Each person will need to start this day with one quart of water for our hike out.Day 7: Our final morning. We'll make about a three-hour, 2,000-foot hike back up to Monument Point and the cars. We\u2019ll all have our \u201cCanyon legs\u201d by then, so this should simply be an aerobic activity!

As the fourth-largest island in the world that is nearly the size of Texas and was formerly a part of the ancient supercontinent Gondwana, Madagascar has developed an incredible plethora of unique and exotic flora and fauna. Madagascar is sometimes called the \u201cGalapagos of the Indian Ocean.\u201d Splitting from India nearly 90 million years ago, the isolation of this island continent led to the evolution of unique plant and animal species; about 90 percent of the flora and fauna is endemic to Madagascar, including over 50 species of primates known as lemurs and sifakas. Madagascar is truly one of the last remaining wild places in the world.Madagascar is inhabited by the Malagasy, a unique blend of Pacific and African peoples. Although diverse in ethnic origins and local folklore, the people are united by the Malagasy language. This language originated in the ancient Malay-Polynesian, and includes many words from Bantu, Swahili, English, and French. A holdover from colonial days, French is commonly spoken in business transactions as well as in tourist facilities. As we travel through the country, we will meet these friendly people as they go about their daily routines and we will have the chance to talk with them about life in Madagascar.This trip is designed for active people with a sense of adventure. We travel comfortably by private air-conditioned tourist bus, with our own driver and naturalist, enjoying spectacular scenery along the way and feasting on tropical fruits and healthy, fresh, local cuisine with a French influence. We will explore many parts of this extraordinary island, from the colonial capital of Antananarivo to the rainforest home of the indri indri and diademed sifaka in Analamazaotra and Mantadia National Parks, to the spiny forests of the Berenty reserve, which is inhabited by dancing sifakas and mouse lemurs. We will travel to Berenty in 4-wheel-drive vehicles, after our flight from Tulear to Fort Dauphin. We\u2019ll see unique birds with names such as fody, bulbul, vanga, bee-eater, and sunbird. We trek inland to the sculpted beauty of Isalo National Park and through charming and quirky villages and cities. Along the way we stay at several outstanding ecolodges -- one in the verdant rainforest, one in the dry spiny forest, and one in the arid inland desert. We explore the trails of Ranomafana National Park, dedicated to the protection of the golden bamboo and greater bamboo lemur. And finally, we experience some of the colonial charm of days past in the cities and markets of the cities near to Antananarivo. This is a comprehensive tour and truly an adventure of a lifetime -- join us!","highlights":"Marvel at dancing sifaka and call of the indri indri, Explore diverse habitats on naturalist hikes, Engage in the Malagasy cultural heritage","includes":"  Comfortable lodging and all meals,   All admissions and transportation in a private coach,   Naturalist guides","itinerary":"Day 1: Antananarvio (also called Tana)We arrive in the capital city of Antananarivo, with its long, narrow ridges covered with brightly painted homes, and transfer to our hotel. In the evening we enjoy a welcome dinner to meet our travel companions and learn more about our adventure.Day 2: Tana to AndasibeToday we begin our travel, moving west of Antananarivo. Along the way we will stop at a private reserve, where colorful chameleons and snakes are the main attractions. We continue to Andasibe and a lovely forest lodge with small bungalows, where we settle in before dinner.Day 3: AndasibeToday starts with an optional early morning bird walk. After breakfast we embark on a guided visit to the Analamazaotra and Mantadia national parks, where the word \"endemic\" will be heard often as we hike and search for wildlife. There is a good chance that we will hear -- if not see -- the indri indri, one of the largest lemurs, high up in the trees, with its haunting call and unique coloring. When you hear this call, you will understand the origin of the word lemur, derived from a word in Roman mythology for \u201cghost.\" We should also see the diademed sifaka. We return to the lodge for a late lunch and spend the afternoon visiting the lodge's private island park, home to various species of lemurs, including the bamboo and black and white ruffed lemurs. Because they have no predators on the island, they are very curious and unafraid. We enjoy another dinner at the lodge.Day 4: Andasibe to Tana to AntsirabeToday we hike in the reserve next to the lodge, where we should see crested drongos, the brilliant Madagascar green sunbird, and maybe the Madagascar kingfisher. We observe many large crocodiles and also several fossa, a sleek, low-slung carnivore and the largest terrestrial mammal in the country. In the afternoon we head back to Antananarivo, enjoying local markets and daily Malagasy life along the way. We continue to Antsirabe, a Malagasy Vichy town, founded by Norwegians and known for its small craft factories \u2014 one of which makes products from recycled aluminum. The main transport in Antsirabe is the pousse-pousse, which is a colorful rickshaw, often pulled by bare-footed men.Day 5: Antsirabe to FianarantsoaIn the morning, we continue south, stopping in Anbositra to visit a Zafimaniry Art workshop. The Zafimaniry tribe is famous for their wood carvings. A special treat is in store for lunch at Camp Robin, a locale organized by local residents to raise funds for humanitarian and environmental causes. In addition to lunch we enjoy local entertainment and a presentation about the Camp. After lunch we continue on to Fianarantsoa, which means \u201cThe City Where One Can Learn Something Good.\" It is Madagascar\u2019s second-largest city and many regard it as the academic, intellectual, and religious capital of Madagascar. We visit the historic old quarter of town and the vibrant market.Day 6: Fianarantsoa to RanomafanaToday we head east toward the thermal town of Ranomafana (which means \u201chot water\u201d in Malagasy) in the eastern rainforest. We see the vegetation change to luxuriant green forest as we travel into the heart of one of the most famous and spectacular National Parks in all of Madagascar. In the afternoon, we visit Centre ValBio, an international training center for the study of biodiversity, initially founded by Dr. Patricia Wright to protect the golden bamboo lemur. It is now a thriving center with many scientists, researchers, and students, and we have a tour of the property and learn about some of the studies in progress.Day 7: RanomafanaA fantastic day begins with an exploration of Ranomafana National Park with our local guide. This park has the richest biodiversity of any national park in Madagascar, and is particularly known for orchids. We hope to be lucky to see the indri indri again and also the golden bamboo lemur, eastern woolly lemur, red-bellied lemurs, black and white ruffed lemur, small-toothed sportif lemur, diademed sifakas, and red-fronted lemurs as we hike on and off trail. We trek under giant tree ferns, palms, orchids, and giant bamboo forests, looking for the elusive aye-aye. We see various species of birds, such as vangas and the outrageously blue cuoa. Butterflies and dragonflies will accompany us as we explore this fantastic area.\u00a0Day 8: \u00a0Ranomafana to Ranohira (Isalo)\u00a0Today we continue moving south and west, stopping in Ambalavao to visit a winery and a paper factory. We traverse the barren lands and zebu herds of the Bara tribe to arrive at Isalo National Park. This area is reminiscent of the American southwest, with a sandstone and desert quality. After arriving to a welcome drink and cold towel at our luxurious stone lodge in Isalo, we have the remainder of the afternoon to hike amongst the rocks, swim in the refreshing pool, or just laze in the sun.Day 9: Ranohira (Isalo)We spend today in Isalo National Park, where your camera will be busy capturing the sandstone that has been eroded into deep canyons and strange formations, the deep pools in the canyons, and the rugged vistas. With our guide, we walk to see endemic plants, palm trees, verdant creeks, lemurs, and birds. We have time to dip our feet in a pool of cool water. We return to our hotel in the late afternoon and then, just before sunset, we drive to a natural formation called \"The Window,\" renowned for its spectacular setting at the end of the day.Day 10: Ranohira (Isalo) to TulearAfter breakfast, we board our bus and drive toward Tulear, located on the western edge of southern Madagascar. We see Mahafaly tombs and one of the seven types of baobab trees. After passing the mining town of Ilakaka, we visit Zombitse Vohibasia National Park, a transitional pocket forest between the dry and rainforest areas. If we are lucky, we will see lemurs and sifakas as well as the crimson Madagascar fody, butterflies, and perhaps a few geckos.Day 11: Tulear to Fort DauphinBefore our flight, we visit to Arboretum Antsokay. Here we learn about the unique ecosystem of the western shores of Madagascar. We board our plane and fly to the southern tip of the country to Fort Dauphin. Fort Dauphin has three types of ecosystems: dense rainforest with altitudinal differences, xerophila (bush), and transition forest. The area is also well known for its carnivorous plants (nepenthes) and triangular palm trees. Rest this evening at our comfortable city lodging.Day 12: Tulear - Fort Dauphin - BerentyToday transfer directly to Berenty Reserve, a small private tamarind forest reserve set in the semi-arid forest near the Mandrake River. Our rooms here are two-person bungalows crafted from local wood in a lovely well-maintained setting. Around the property, we see ringtail lemurs, possibly including mothers and their clinging babies, and also watch the flight of the bee-eaters in the tall trees. In the evening we enjoy a nocturnal visit to the Spiny Forestor, and a night walk around the hotel grounds, to look for the white-footed sportive lemur and the gray mouse lemur, both of which are active at night.Day 13: BerentyToday is our full day to savor and visit the larger Berenty Reserve trails with guided walks. This reserve has flora and fauna characteristic of the spiny forest of Androy and many types of lemurs. Early in the morning, we may come across tribes of 'dancing' Verreaux\u2019s sifakas side-stepping down the forest pathways. This is a delightful experience. We also visit the informative Museum of Androy on the reserve grounds, perhaps seeing the bizarre-looking hoopoe bird nearby. In the afternoon, we travel to a dry spiny forest and look for the mouse lemur, a tiny lemur that sleeps deep within the spiny Euphorbias during the day. We may also see the Scops Owl burrowed in the spiny Euphorbias as well.Day 14: Berenty - Fort DauphinWe leave Berenty after breakfast, driving through the landscape of zebu ranching interspersed with rice fields. We see small villages and communities eking a living out of this harsh landscape, stopping in a local market for photos and perhaps a banana. We visit Andohahela Park, a transitional area between dry and humid zones, to observe the adaptations of plants and animals for their habitat. In the afternoon, we continue to Fort Dauphin for the evening and settle into our comfortable hotel.Day 15: Fort Dauphin to Antananarivo (Tana)If time allows, we take a walking tour of Fort Dauphin and its scenic waterfront views. We board our flight back to Tana and head for The Digue market place, Antananarivo's largest handicraft marketplace, located outside the city center. This market offers a wide range of minerals, semi-precious stones, wood carvings, zebu horn and leather items, and various decor elements. \u00a0Day 16: Antananarivo (Tana)We visit Ambohimanga (Blue Hill) the palace of Queen Ranavalona, which is a UNESCO site. In the afternoon, we tour the city, visiting other famous sites such as Anosy Lake, Independance Avenue (the Malagasy version of Champs Elys\u00e9es), and the old central station with French colonial architecture. In the evening we share a final celebratory dinner, reveling in our journey and experiences.Day 17: Homeward BoundWe say goodbye to this fascinating country and new friends until our next adventure.While every effort will be made to follow this itinerary, our plans may change due to weather, changes in flight schedules, or other circumstances beyond our control.","leader1":"Kath Giel","leader2":"","leader3":""}},{"trip":{"title":"New York City Parks Service at the Historic Bartow-Pell Conservancy, New York","id":"18300A","dates":"Oct 7, 2018 to Oct 14, 2018","destination":"United States, New York","type":"Service\/Volunteer","group":"","difficulty":"","priceHigh":"795","priceLow":"795","image":{"src":"https:\/\/content.sierraclub.org\/outings\/sites\/content.sierraclub.org.outings\/files\/styles\/trip-teaser\/public\/trips\/main-images\/16284_1_RichardGrayson.jpg?itok=jbV_N_1T","alt":""},"path":"\/outings\/new-york-city-parks-service-conservancy#trip=18300A","overview":"The TripTucked inside Pelham Bay Park -- New York City's largest park, at 2,764 acres -- is the historic Bartow-Pell Mansion. In 1654, Thomas Pell acquired the land that became the park from the Siwanoy Indians. The Greek Revival Bartow-Pell Mansion was built between 1836 and 1842 by Robert Bartow, a Pell descendant. It was one of some 22 grand country houses built by New York City's wealthy families who wanted to escape Manhattan's summer heat and humidity. It is the only house to have survived. At the time, the area was so remote that the best way to reach it from Manhattan was by boat. The mansion was beautifully restored in the early 20th century by the International Garden Club, which has since become the Bartow-Pell Conservancy. The mansion is both a National Historic Landmark and a New York City Landmark--EXPANDFROMHERE--. A museum since 1946, it has a wonderful collection of 19th-century furnishings and decorative arts.Pelham Bay Park is located in Bronx County, one of the five boroughs (counties) in the City of New York.

New England\u2019s largest island, the Vineyard lies four miles south of Woods Hole off the coast of Cape Cod. Triangular in shape, the island is 20 miles long and nine miles wide. Formed by glaciers over 10,000 years ago, the Vineyard\u2019s distinctive landscape consists of kettle ponds, open meadows, dense forests, steep cliffs, and natural harbors. Its globally rare habitats include coastal sandplains, grassland heaths, and scrub oak woodlands.The Vineyard\u2019s bountiful lands and waters provided ample sustenance to Native Americans long before the first European settlers arrived in 1642. Over the next 200 years, islanders made their living as fishermen, merchant seamen, pilots, and whalers. Tourism constitutes the primary economy now. The island\u2019s rich history is evident in its six towns. Each has its own individual character expressed in widely divergent architectural styles -- from the gingerbread cottages of Oak Bluffs to Edgartown's aristocratic, white-clapboard sea captains' homes and the traditional fishing village of Menemsha. Today, farmers and fishermen remain close to the land and sea in the company of celebrities of all stripes.\u00a0The ProjectSince 2000, Sierra Club groups have partnered with the Massachusetts chapter of The Nature Conservancy (TNC) in its Islands Program. TNC seeks to protect the Vineyard\u2019s significant ecosystems and preserve biodiversity in the face of unrelenting development pressures. While protecting land is one key strategy, TNC also seeks to restore the island\u2019s once-expansive sandplain habitats by replanting native species in these rare seaside prairies. Through its work with many local environmental groups, the Conservancy has become a leading voice in the fight to safeguard the island's special qualities.Specific tasks will be based on the Conservancy's most pressing needs at the time of our trip. Sierra Club groups have tackled numerous projects, mostly involving the removal of invasive species and working in TNC's nursery for native plants. Invasives include oriental bittersweet, multiflora rose, Scotch broom, honeysuckle, and black locust. In the nursery we have collected and sorted seeds, helped with weeding, and field-planted native species. We've helped with pitch pine removal around the island in order to restore the rich biodiversity of globally rare sandplain grasslands.","highlights":"Help restore the Vineyard's globally rare habitats, Explore charming island towns, Bike, hike, or bird during free time","includes":"  All meals,   Lodging at Hoft Farm,   Tour of Cape Poge Lighthouse on Chappaquiddick Island","itinerary":"We will meet at Hoft Farm on the north shore of Martha's Vineyard, less than four miles from the ferry landing in Vineyard Haven and six miles from the Oak Bluffs ferry.

We\u2019ll stop at Welch Spring and view the ruins of the Welch Spring Hospital. In 1913 Illinois doctor C.H. Diehl bought Welch Spring for $800 and built a hospital and resort, believing that the spring water and pollen-free cave air would heal people with asthma, emphysema, and tuberculosis. When Dr. Diehl died in 1945 his project was being referred to as \"Diehl's Folly.\" We can cross the river to visit Maggard\u2019s Cabin, located downriver from Welch Spring. We\u2019ll camp near Aker\u2019s Ferry, the Current River\u2019s final operating ferry. After setting up camp, we can hike to the Aker\u2019s Ferry General Store to purchase ice cream, sodas, souvenirs, or necessities. This evening we may be joined by a National Park Service interpretative ranger who can educate us about the Ozark National Scenic Riverways and the Park Service\u2019s current projects, the region\u2019s history, flora and fauna, and answer our questions. Aker\u2019s Ferry campsite has basic amenities: pit toilets, tables, and fire grills.Day 4: (Aker\u2019s Ferry to Pulltite) From Aker\u2019s Ferry we\u2019ll paddle to Pulltite. Along the route today is Troublesome Hollow, the \"Pothole,\" and Rock House Cave (aka Meeting House Cave). Both armies used Meeting House Cave as a hideout during the Civil War. We\u2019ll canoe to Cave Spring Cave (average flow of 24 million gallons\/day) and we can hike up the Cave Spring Trail to the Devil\u2019s Well. A Native American dugout canoe was discovered on the bottom of the Cave Spring. We\u2019ll camp at the Pulltite Spring Campground facility and we can hike the campground nature trail, look for ripe persimmons and paw-paws, and perhaps visit the hilltop Weese cemetery. This evening the Missouri Sierra Club\u2019s Ozarks Conservation Program Coordinator may join us to talk to us about the conservation issues affecting the Ozark National Scenic Riverways. Pulltite has electricity, indoor toilets and hot showers, RV dump stations, electric hook-ups, reservation systems, and campground hosts.Day 5: (Pulltite to Round Springs) After breaking camp we\u2019ll cross the river to visit the Pulltite Spring, a clear, aqua-blue spring lush with watercress and aquatic plants. The Pulltite Cabin is just down the trail from Pulltite Spring. The cabin was constructed in the \"French-style\" around a massive fireplace and finished Thanksgiving 1913. Moving on down river, there are more caves (Shelter Cave, Merritt Rock Cave, Bat Cave, Hole in the Rock), more springs (Fire Hydrant Spring and Sand Boil Spring), Sinking Creek and more opportunities to fish. We\u2019ll take out at Round Spring. We can view Round Spring, a deep-blue spring that produces 33 million gallons of water per day. Local legend says one foggy Ozark night a wagon crashed into the spring; in 1978, divers discovered wagon wheels 55 feet down. We\u2019ll be met by our canoe outfitter at Round Spring and shuttled back to the outfitter\u2019s campground to our vehicles and prepare for our journey home.","leader1":"Bill Nichols","leader2":"Holly Johnson","leader3":""}},{"trip":{"title":"Grand Staircase-Escalante Llama Hike, Utah","id":"18184A","dates":"Oct 7, 2018 to Oct 13, 2018","destination":"United States, Utah","type":"Supported Trekking","group":"","difficulty":"3 (out of 5)","priceHigh":"2345","priceLow":"2345","image":{"src":"https:\/\/content.sierraclub.org\/outings\/sites\/content.sierraclub.org.outings\/files\/styles\/trip-teaser\/public\/trips\/main-images\/16299_1_ElaineGrace.jpg?itok=gL7rvfV9","alt":""},"path":"\/outings\/grand-staircase-escalante-llama-hike-utah#trip=18184A","overview":"The TripOur trip will emphasize enjoying the wilderness experience and learning to understand and appreciate the unique aspects of Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument while minimizing the impacts of our presence in the wilderness.

Tools, figurines, petroglyphs, pictographs, baskets, pithouses, and other archaeological artifacts have been found sprinkled throughout the Canyon. John Wesley Powell's exploration of the Colorado River in 1869 led prospectors, railroad men, and promoters to dream of ways to turn the wonders of the Grand Canyon into personal fortunes. Yet not until after World War II did tourists and hikers begin to seek out the area's beauty and solitude. Harvey Butchart came to Flagstaff during the postwar period to teach mathematics at Northern Arizona University--EXPANDFROMHERE--. Intrepid backcountry hikers like us are indebted to him for the 40 years he spent exploring and writing about the Grand Canyon's backcountry in his free time.Remote and dramatic, the area we will visit has spectacular scenery unparalleled in the world. Prehistoric Puebloan ruins with potsherds and other artifacts may be seen along our route, and prospectors used some of them to build their own shelters. Ben Beamer prospected along the banks of the Colorado, leaving behind the trail we'll use that bears his name. He even farmed in the area. Other prospectors such as George McCormick, who had a mine at Palisades Creek, and Seth Tanner, who had a trail named after him (which we will descend), spent their lives trying to strike it rich in the Canyon in the late 19th century. Our journey will also take us on the Escalante route, named after an 18th-century Spanish Explorer, Father Silvestre Velez de Escalante, who was more interested in converting Hopi souls than in exploring the vast canyons of the area. And finally we will ascend the New Hance Trail. John Hance built a small tourist ranch on the South Rim and was a consummate raconteur, telling his guests fabulous tales as he guided them down his trail in the late 1800s.\u00a0The geology of the Grand Canyon is appreciated around the world, but the area we will visit is particularly rich. In addition to all the usual geological layers from Kaibab limestone to the Tapeats sandstone, what we will see are layers of the Super Group, seen clearly in this area of Grand Canyon.We will have time to relax and enjoy this vast and magnificent wilderness even though we will still have one or two long days. It's usually dry this time of year, so rain should not be a problem. The weather could be ideal -- usually warm during the day (about 85 degrees) and cooler at night (about 55 degrees). Canyon weather can vary significantly, and be hotter, colder, or wetter than expected.","highlights":"Experience breathtaking Grand Canyon, Camp near the Colorado River most nights, See Earth's geological history firsthand","includes":"  Adventure ,   All meals and cooking equipment ,   Permits and experienced fellow Sierra Club guidance","itinerary":"Day 1:\u00a0We will begin our trip at Lipan Point, about 1.5 miles from our exit point along the South Rim Drive, close to where we will leave some of our vehicles during the trip.\u00a0From the pullout at Moran Point, Hance Rapid can be seen over 4,000 feet below; it's at this point where we'll leave the river to hike out on our second-to-last day. After setting up our short car shuttle, we head to Lipan Point, and the top of the Tanner Trail. It is roughly 9 miles and close to 4,700 feet from the top of this trail to the Colorado River, where we will encounter our first water. We will camp near the river, either at the Tanner Beach or nearby, depending on how our permit application goes--EXPANDFROMHERE--.\u00a0Day 2:\u00a0Today, we start on the Beamer Trail, a trail we will be on or near for the next few days. We will camp a little ways downstream from the confluence of the Little Colorado and the main Colorado. The total distance from the Tanner Beach to the Little Colorado River along the Beamer Trail is 9.5 miles.\u00a0We will have views of the Colorado River the entire day.Day 3:\u00a0This morning\u00a0we will explore without packs the Little Colorado River from our camp near the confluence. If we are lucky, and the Little Colorado River is not flooding, we will enjoy the amazing colors and travertine pools. Swimming is certainly an option as the water temperature of the Little Colorado is substantially higher than the main Colorado River. After lunch back at our camp we will break camp and hike downstream about 5 miles on the Beamer Trail to a camp near Palisades Creek.Day 4:\u00a0Our journey continues downstream -- sometimes climbing but always returning to the Colorado. We will pass the intersection with the Tanner Trail and leave the Beamer Trail behind as we start on the Escalante Route to Red Canyon. We will continue for another couple of hours to our campsite near the Colorado at Cardenas Creek. Today, we will see Cardenas Lava and Dox Sandstone as we hike though the Unkar Group stratigraphy. Our hike today is about 7 miles with a gain of about 400 feet and a loss of 500 feet for a total loss of about 100 feet today.\u00a0Day 5:\u00a0Today is a longer day along the Escalante Route, with some substantial climbs and descents as well as serpentine hiking around side canyons. But we will have big views from some of the higher points. We will also see lots of pink Shinumo quartzite along the Colorado. Our camp between 75-mile Canyon and Papago is along a great beach for camping, with a long stretch of rapids. We gain and lose over 1,500 feet during our 5 miles of hiking today.\u00a0Day 6:\u00a0This morning we will hike up Papago Canyon without packs and then follow the last mile of the Escalante route to Red Canyon, so named because of the bright red of the Hakati Shale. We will pause at Hance Rapid for lunch and a possible swim. In the afternoon, we will hike up Red Canyon a couple of miles on the New Hance Trail, taking a look at the oldest member of the Unkar Group, the Bass Limestone, as we leave the river behind us. Going up-canyon in the streambed it will take us up about 600 feet and provide a camp near some small pools of water.Day 7:\u00a0After leaving the streambed, our last morning will be a steep ascent of 4,000 feet over 4 miles.

The wildly diverse ecosystems of the Galapagos Islands provide a haven for unique wildlife -- half of their species are found nowhere else. And the magic is, they are approachable by humans. Animals do not run off and birds do not fly away, likely due to a lack of natural predators -- a condition created by the very processes of evolution that first stirred Darwin to speculation in 1835. The Galapagos Islands are among the world\u2019s foremost wildlife preserves, providing us with unique and amazing experiences. Examples include the three-foot-long vegetarian marine iguana, the only known sea-feeding lizard on earth, and the Galapagos tortoise, which grows to six feet in length, weighs up to 600 pounds, and lives for at least 150 years! The archipelago also boasts colorful Sally Lightfoot crabs, sea lions, land iguanas, and lava lizards--EXPANDFROMHERE--. A prolific bird population includes frigate birds, penguins, boobies, tropicbirds, mocking birds, doves, albatross, hawks, gulls, cormorants, herons, warblers, flamingos, and the famous Darwin finches.Charles Darwin, of course, was the archipelago\u2019s most famous visitor. His chapter on the Galapagos in \u201cThe Voyage of the Beagle\u201d remains a classic, and is well worth reading. \u201cThe natural history of these islands is eminently curious\u201d he wrote, and with his collections of plants and animals, observations, and notes, he had sufficient material to support more than a quarter-century of research. Twenty-four years later, he published \u201cOn the Origin of Species.\" It shook the foundations of biological thought and led to profound changes in man\u2019s philosophy of nature.\u00a0Known as \u201cthe Enchanted Islands\" (named by Herman Melville, another early visitor), the Galapagos is a world-class destination! The swirling fogs that surround the islands at certain times of the year give rise to the legend that these were floating islands.On this trip we will stay at hotels on two inhabited Galapagos Islands: Santa Cruz and Isabela. Taking \u201cfast boats\u201d between Islands, we will have an opportunity to spot sea life such as sea birds, dolphins, sea turtles, rays, sea lions -- maybe even a whale. We will have the opportunity to snorkel to get a close look at the marine life. On land, we will observe the sere landscape with its fascinating geologic features, stroll in tropical rainforests, visit an active volcano (sporting the world\u2019s second-largest caldera), do some hiking or birding, or loll around at the beach. Our days will be filled with activity, but you'll also have the freedom to just relax. An English-speaking certified Galapagos naturalist will accompany us and help us understand the intricate relationships between plants, animals, people, and their environment.Santa Cruz Island (also known as Indefatigable) is the second-largest in the Galapagos. Wild Galapagos Tortoises roam free; flycatchers, Darwin's finches, and owls fill the forests; sea lions, marine iguanas, pelicans, and boobies abound. This island also has the largest human population within the island chain. We\u2019ll spend two nights in Puerto Ayora, the largest town in the Galapagos.Isabela Island (also known as Albermarle) is the largest in the Galapagos Archipelago. It was formed by the merger of six shield volcanos, including Volc\u00e1n Sierra Negra, which we will visit. We\u2019ll spend three nights close to the beach in the small town of Puerto Villamil, which will serve as our base for hiking and snorkeling adventures. Isabela is home to more wild tortoises than all the other islands.We will also visit Machu Picchu in Peru!\u00a0Machu Picchu is the site of an ancient Inca city, high in the Andes of Peru. Located at 8,000 feet above sea level, this UNESCO World Heritage site is often referred to as \"The Lost City of the Incas.\" It's one of the most familiar symbols of the Incan Empire and also one of the most famous and spectacular sets of ruins in the world. A visit to Peru would not be complete without visiting this treasure!It's no wonder Machu Picchu is Peru's most-visited site. Dating to the mid-1400s, it's a marvel of mortar-free limestone architecture perched on a high plateau deep in the Amazonian jungle. This citadel is considered one of the most extraordinary examples of landscape architecture in the world.The story of Machu Picchu is quite a remarkable one; it is still unknown exactly what the site was in terms of its place in Inca life. Current researchers tend to believe that Machu Picchu was a country resort for elite Incas. At any given time, there were no more than 750 people living at Machu Picchu, with far fewer than that during the rainy season. The Incas started building it around 1430 AD, but it was abandoned as an official site for the Inca rulers a hundred years later at the time of the Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire.One thing that is clear is that it was a remarkably well-hidden place, and well protected. Located high in the mountains of Peru, visitors had to travel up long valleys littered with Inca check points and watch towers. Remarkably, the Spanish conquistadors missed the site. These remarkable ruins became known to the scientific world in 1911, after the American archaeologist Hiram Bingham was led to the site by locals (he was on a trip sponsored by Yale University, actually looking for Vilacabamba, the last Inca hideout).\u00a0We also travel through the Sacred Valley to visit several other Inca sites such as Qorikancha, Sacsayhuaman (affectionally called \u201cSexy Woman\u201d), Ollantaytambo, and Pisac. These sites will give you better understanding of the incredible Inca culture and engineering accomplishments before our arrival in Machu Picchu.","highlights":"Explore world-renowned wildlife & ruin destinations, Lodge on Gal\u00e1pagos Islands, interact with locals, Tour the Sacred Valley of the Incas and Machu Picchu","includes":"  All meals, lodging, and on-trip transportation,   All admissions, entry fees, and gratuities,   Galapagos-certified naturalist, English-speaking guides","itinerary":"Day 1: Arrive in Guayaquil, a modern city and the major seaport of Ecuador. You will be met upon arrival and transferred to our hotel. We will plan an orientation meeting in the morning, followed by some local activities based on group interests. Lunch and dinner will be provided at local restaurants. To take advantage of this, it is recommended you arrive the day before.\u00a0Day 2: Today is devoted to exploring some highlights of Guayaquil, including a visit to a cocoa plantation and factory where we will learn about this indigenous plant, and why Ecuador has world-class chocolate. We\u2019ll return to the hotel at day\u2019s end to enjoy an Ecuadorian dinner.Day 3: On to the Galapagos Islands! The flight to and from the Galapagos Islands is included in the trip price. Tickets will be issued at the Guayaquil Airport before we leave for the islands. At the airport on Isla Baltra we will meet our Certified Galapagos Guide. We\u2019ll then collect our luggage, take a short shuttle ride to a short ferry ride, and then drive across Santa Cruz Island, stopping to visit the amazing cloud forest Highlands and view our first giant tortoises! We\u2019ll enjoy a lunch in the Highlands, then head to Puerto Ayora, where we will catch a \u201cfast boat\u201d for the transit to Isle Isabella. Our hotel is a short walk from the port, and we\u2019ll check in and relax over dinner.Day 4: Today we visit Volc\u00e1n Sierra Negra, one of the six volcanos that form Isle Isabela. We start at the Ranger Station, about a 45-minute drive (3,000 feet above sea level), and gain about 700 feet during our hike. At Volc\u00e1n Sierra Negra (elevation 3,688 feet), we will view the world\u2019s second-largest caldera -- 6 miles wide and 300 feet deep. We walk along the rim for a short while. On a clear day you get spectacular views. Then on Volc\u00e1n Chico, we can see volcanic activity as we observe the fumaroles. You will notice a shocking difference in the landscape -- from lush vegetation around Sierra Negra to the lava moon-scape area around Volcano Chico. Round trip is about 10 miles. We walk through several different climate zones along the route. There are points along the route to stop and wait for the more ambitious hikers if you chose. After a bit of hiking and a picnic lunch, we will return to Puerto Villamil to relax or hang out at the beach, enjoy the views and wildlife, and have dinner.\u00a0Day 5:\u00a0This morning visit Cabo Rosa, one of the best places to snorkel in the Galapagos. There are lava formations, lava bridges, and lava tunnels in the water that provide for a marine paradise in these crystal-clear waters. This is a good spot to look for the unique flightless cormorant, golden rays, sea lions, sea turtles, and penguins. As time allows, we'll further explore Puerto Villamil (population about 2,300), situated along a stunning expanse of white beaches. We may visit the lovely gardens at the Giant Turtle Center (Analdo Tupiza), where tortoises are protected in their first years of life before being released in the wild; or take a short walk to the nearby lagoon, where we might be rewarded with sightings of flamingos, ducks, and other water birds. This is our last night on Isabela.Day 6: We\u2019ll return by boat back to Santa Cruz Island this morning. We visit the Charles Darwin Research Station as time allows. Then in the afternoon we visit Tortuga Bay, one of the most stunning beaches in the Galapagos, accessible only by foot and home to hundreds of prehistoric-looking marine iguanas, blue-footed boobies, and pelicans. We\u2019ll even see turtle nesting sites. Dinner will be at a local restaurant.Day 7:\u00a0Today we have a boat excursion to North Seymore Island. We\u2019ll enjoy a relaxing lunch on this larger boat and enjoy a walk where we\u2019ll see abundant birds and other native species at close range, typically including blue footed boobies, frigate birds, land iguanas, and many other species of birds. Later in the day we will stop at the beach for another chance to snorkel in the clear waters.Day 8:\u00a0After breakfast at our hotel, we must go to the airport, bid farewell to our Island Paradise, and head back to Guayaquil. If time permits, we will be able to organize some activities such as taking a walk along the Malec\u00f3n (River Walk) to stretch our legs, visiting museums, or just relaxing at the hotel. Dinner tonight is at the hotel where we prepare to depart for Peru in the morning.Day 9:\u00a0On the move again! We depart for our international flights to the ancient city of Cusco, Peru, the former Inca capital. This flight is included in the trip price. We'll spend the remainder of the day catching our breath -- literally -- as we get used to Cusco\u2019s 11,200-foot altitude. This beautiful red-tile-roofed city was founded in the 12th-century by Manco Capac, the original Inca who was considered to be a child of the sun god himself. For almost 400 years, Cusco served as the flourishing capital of the Inca Empire and still retains its centuries-old appeal with numerous sections of original Inca stonework visible in the streets and buildings. Upon arrival, we will enjoy a walking tour near our hotel to see Qorikancha and the cathedral as time allows. Gentle walking helps to adjust to the altitude. We'll enjoy a relaxed dinner this evening at the hotel.\u00a0Day 10:\u00a0We have a morning departure for an amazing bus tour to the nearby Sacred Valley with its endless views and stunning archaeology. We visit Sacsayhuaman (also affectionally called \u201cSexy Woman\u201d) and the Indian Market of Pisac, which attracts people from remote communities dressed in colorful, traditional attire. This region (and the Pisac market) is well-known for high quality local crafts, including hand-knit wools, ceramics, leather goods, and jewelry. After a stop for lunch we continue by bus to Ollantaytambo, which features an extensive archaeological site located on the imposing hillside overlooking the town, containing structures such as the Temple of the Sun and the Royal Hall.From here we take a train (included) from Ollantaytambo to Aguas Calientes (also known as Machu Picchu Pueblo) where we will have dinner and spend two nights.Day 11:\u00a0A day in Machu Picchu! This will be a highlight. In the morning, we will have a relaxed schedule. We will have an hour tour of the Rock Sculptures along the river called Aguas Calientes, which flows into the Urubamba River. Our tour to Machu Picchu is in the afternoon, as mornings have a higher chance of overcast weather. We take a bus to the ruins, and start with a buffet lunch at the hotel there. Our knowledgeable guide will then give us a tour of the ruins, explaining the current theories regarding the purpose and significance of the city. After the tour you will have time to wander in this magnificent and sacred place -- maybe hiking to the Gate of the Sun (Intipunku) or the Inca Bridge. Many just take photos at their leisure of the ruins or the llamas that frequent this area. You can stay until 5 p.m. to enjoy the late-afternoon light on these unforgettable ruins, or you can opt to return to the hotel, enjoy the local hot springs baths (not included), or visit the markets. We have dinner tonight at our hotel.\u00a0Day 12:\u00a0After breakfast, the morning is unstructured. You may want to shop at the many local shops, visit the Butterfly Farm, take an extended hike, or just relax. You also have the option to return to Machu Picchu if permits are still available (but note that the cost of the permit and a second bus fare is not included). Lunch is at a local restaurant, then we take the afternoon train back to Cusco. This evening we are in for a treat: a cultural show with our farewell dinner that will have Peruvian dancers in complete costumes.\u00a0Day 13: Our trip ends after breakfast. You'll have the options of flying home, staying longer in Cusco, or visiting other places in beautiful Peru. We will say goodbye to our new Peruvian friends and reflect on the grand finale of our visit to Machu Picchu. Transfers will be provided to the airport on this day only.\u00a0Important notes:Occasionally, changes may occur in the trip -- either in advance or during the trip. Please be aware that we will make every attempt to stay within this itinerary. However, we may need to make changes for a variety of reasons (weather, equipment, Galapagos National Park Services, Peru Park Services, or other conditions, circumstances, or situations) to assure the safety and enjoyment of the entire group. Please be flexible and respect the decision of your trip leader. The safety of the group is our number one concern.While wildlife on the Galapagos Islands is tremendous, we cannot guarantee that you will see all species listed as examples.Your passport must be valid for at least six months from the starting date of this trip, and have at least six consecutive blank pages.

We\u2019ll visit Durbar (Palace) Square in Patan, one of Kathmandu\u2019s ancient royal centers. After lunch we\u2019ll visit Pashupatinath, Nepal\u2019s biggest Hindu shrine. After dinner we\u2019ll have time to organize our gear and pack our duffel bags for tomorrow\u2019s flight to the Everest region.\u00a0Day 3: After an early breakfast, we head to the airport for a 30-minute flight to Lukla (9,383 feet elevation), one of the world\u2019s highest and most interesting airports. After meeting our porters and seeing them set off with our duffels, we\u2019ll have a mid-morning snack and then hike to our lodge at Phakding at 9,200 feet, stopping along the way for tea and cookies. Depending on our progress, we may decide to have lunch on the way, or perhaps we\u2019ll wait till we arrive at Phakding. It'll be about a three-hour hike, with a fair amount of up and down.\u00a0Day 4: Today we'll hike from Phakding to Namche Bazaar (11,285 feet elevation, gain of 2,000 feet, 5-6 hours steadily uphill). We\u2019ll cross several high suspension bridges and will frequently step aside along the trail to allow the passage of porters or animals carrying supplies. Namche is the largest village in the area, with many shops and markets to explore.\u00a0Day 5: This is our rest and acclimatization day in Namche, with an optional walk to the nearby National Park Center and the Sherpa Museum. We\u2019ll have time to wander the teeming streets of this famous jumping-off spot for Everest climbers.\u00a0Day 6: Today\u2019s hike offers views of Everest, Ama Dablam, and Lhotse as we walk up to Tengboche (12,700 feet elevation, gain of 1,500 feet, and five to six hours hiking). This is the site of Khumbu\u2019s largest monastery, perched on a ridge overlooking a pine and rhododendron forest.\u00a0Day 7: We have a rest day here at Tengboche to adjust to the increasing altitude. We may be awakened by cymbals and horns as the monks are called for prayers. Options today include hiking up to a nearby viewpoint, walking around the monastery and village, and sitting with the monks as they chant from the Buddhist scriptures. \u00a0Day 8: We'll hike to Dingboche (14,465 feet elevation, gain of 1,700 feet, four to five hours), passing beside long mani walls made up of large stones inscribed with sacred Buddhist writings.\u00a0Day 9: Today we'll hike to Chhukhung (15,515 feet elevation, gain of 1,050 feet, two to three hours). This is a broad, tundra-like valley dominated by Ama Dablam on one side and Lhotse and Nuptse on the other.\u00a0Day 10: We'll have another layover day, with a day hike to Chhukhung Ri (18,200 feet elevation, gain of 2,700 feet, two to three hours). The view from the top in clear weather is awe-inspiring. This should be one of the highlights of our trip. This hike is also an important part of our acclimatization process as it will help us prepare for our climb to Kala Patthar a few days from now. We should be back at our lodge in time for a little afternoon nap. Sleeping at this elevation is also an important part of the acclimatization process.Day 11: Today, we'll hike back down to Dingboche (14,465 feet elevation, loss of 1,700 feet, two hours).\u00a0Day 12: We'll hike to Lobouche (16,175 feet elevation, gain of 1,700 feet, three to four hours). This trail goes up steeply in places and tops out at a ridge marked by chortens, cairns, and prayer flags honoring those who have died climbing Everest. We will look back down the valley for magnificent views.\u00a0Day 13: Today we'll hike to the original site of Everest Base Camp at Gorak Shep (17,100 feet elevation, gain of 1,000 feet, four hours). After resting for lunch, we\u2019ll continue on to the present-day Everest Base Camp site, a five mile round-trip that typically takes four to five hours, with a 500-foot elevation gain. At this high elevation, some trekkers prefer to rest at the lodge for the afternoon, rather than continue on, and this is a perfectly acceptable option, too.\u00a0Day 14: We will get up and pack our duffel bags so our porters can get an early start while we hike up to Kala Patthar (18,450 feet elevation, gain of 1,350 feet, one and a half to two hours) for the best view of Everest and the surrounding peaks. We hope the skies will be clear, as they usually are in the morning. Before the wind comes up, we\u2019ll descend Kala Patthar and continue hiking back down the valley to Lobouche (16,175 feet elevation, loss of 2,225 feet, four to five hours).\u00a0Day 15: Today we\u2019ll descend to Pheriche (13,911 feet elevation, loss of 2,200 feet, three to four hours). This trail segment will seem like a lot of downhill hiking, but by then we\u2019ll be ready for it. Pheriche is a small village with a Health Post of the Himalayan Rescue Association, which is occasionally open to provide medical assistance to local villagers during the fall, although their busiest time is during the spring climbing season.\u00a0Day 16: Today we\u2019ll hike to Phortse (12,467 feet elevation, loss of 1,450 feet, four and a half hours). Phortse is a pleasant Sherpa village with stone walled fields planted with buckwheat and potatoes. Yaks graze here and we may see Tengboche and Namche Bazaar in the distance.\u00a0Day 17: Today we will hike to Khumjung (12,430 feet elevation, loss and gain of 1,000 feet). This is an up and down day, and a short one. We will arrive by lunchtime and have plenty of time to do our laundry along with the locals at the village tap.\u00a0Day 18: This will be our last rest day on the trek. We will visit the monastery, the hospital, and, if possible, also spend some quality time at the world\u2019s highest bakery. Wherever you look, you\u2019ll have a great view.\u00a0Day 19: Today we will return to Phakding (9,200 feet elevation, loss of 3,200 feet), passing through Namche Bazaar and taking our last walk down the winding streets.\u00a0Day 20: We'll hike back to our starting point of Lukla (9,383 feet elevation) and prepare for our end-of-trek dinner and party with our entire staff. There will be singing, dancing, drumming, toasts, and (brief!) speeches, and it will be over too soon.\u00a0Day 21: Today we'll fly back to Kathmandu for a relaxing lunch at the Garden of Dreams. We\u2019ll have several hours of free time this afternoon to shop for that special thangka painting or statue before our dinner at a traditional Nepalese restaurant.\u00a0Day 22: We have a half day of sightseeing starting at Bodhanath, the largest Buddhist stupa in Nepal and the center of Kathmandu\u2019s Tibetan exile community. Next, we\u2019ll visit the ancient royal center of Bhaktapur, once a separate kingdom but now part of the Kathmandu metropolis. The rest of the day will be free for packing as we prepare for our final evening together.\u00a0Day 23: After breakfast we\u2019ll head to the Kathmandu airport for our return flights home, leaving Nepal with memories of a lifetime. Transportation to the airport is provided.","leader1":"Bill Flower","leader2":"Mike Abbott","leader3":""}},{"trip":{"title":"Sea and Service at Point Reyes National Seashore, California","id":"18301A","dates":"Oct 20, 2018 to Oct 27, 2018","destination":"United States, California","type":"Service\/Volunteer","group":"","difficulty":"","priceHigh":"575","priceLow":"575","image":{"src":"https:\/\/content.sierraclub.org\/outings\/sites\/content.sierraclub.org.outings\/files\/styles\/trip-teaser\/public\/trips\/main-images\/17082_1_FrancineWai.jpg?itok=hwGvU4wX","alt":"Photo: Francine Wai"},"path":"\/outings\/service-point-reyes-seashore-california#trip=18301A","overview":"The TripEnjoy scenic views of the Pacific Ocean while working to restore native plant species in Point Reyes National Seashore.

Bhutan greets us with clear air, absence of noise, and the fragrance of pines. Temple-studded hills and prayer flags dotting the landscape will tell you that you are in no ordinary place. We will meet our guide and drive about 1.5 hours to our hotel in Thimphu -- the only capital city in the world without a traffic light. After lunch at our hotel, we will enjoy sightseeing in and around Thimphu. Overnight at hotel.Day 2:\u00a0After breakfast at the hotel, we will have a morning of unforgettable visits. First stop will be the Memorial Chorten (Stupa), built in memory of the 3rd King, Jigme Dorji Wangchuk. Then on to visit one of the few nunneries in Bhutan, Drubthop Lhakhang, built in the 15th century. Our last stop is Tushi Chodzong, the office of the King and the Ministers and the summer house for Bhutan's spiritual leader and monks. \u00a0We return to our hotel in Thimphu for the evening.Day 3:\u00a0After breakfast, we will visit the Thimphu weekend market, a set of permanent stalls displaying produce and goods locally and around Bhutan. Next on the itinerary is the Painting School, where the traditional art of painting Thangkhas (sacred Buddhist religious scrolls) is kept alive. The Traditional Medicine Institute follows. A drive to the Lungtenzampa to observe traditional silversmiths and the paper factory is also planned. Lunch will be served in a restaurant.\u00a0After lunch, we drive north of Thimphu 40 minutes, cross a bridge that spans the Wang\/Thimphu Chhu River, and begin our hike up to the Tango Monastery (approximately one hour). Our drive back may involve a stop at the Pangri Zampa temple, a site in a grove of giant cypress trees where the monastic institute for astrologic studies resides. We return to our hotel in Thimphu with a stroll through the town, including a long row of stalls selling Bhutanese products of various sorts.Day 4:\u00a0Leaving Thimphu to Punakha, the road climbs steeply through a row of pine and cedar to Dochula pass (3,050 meters\/10,006 feet). With a clear view, this pass offers a view of Himalayan mountain ranges. We will be dropped off at the mule track, where we will hike through rhododendron, magnolia, juniper, and pine forest with birds of many varieties along the path. We will then drive to lunch. Following lunch, we will have a short hike to Chimi Lhakhang temple on top of a small hill. This temple is dedicated to the 14th-century Yogi Drukpa Kuenley, or more popularly to Westerners as the \u201cDivine Madman.\" It is believed that this temple blesses women who desire fertility. Our drive north stops at the Punakha Dzong, situated between the junction of the Phochu and Mochu rivers. Built in the 17th and 18th\u00a0centuries, this magnificent structure is considered the most beautiful in Bhutan. This dzong serves as the district administrative and judiciary office as well as the winter home for Bhutan\u2019s spiritual leader Je Khenpo and 600 monks of Thimphu and Punakha. We will then head to our hotel in Punakha.Day 5:\u00a0After an early breakfast, we will drive to the Phobjikha Valley through Wangdue at an elevation of 1,350 meters (4,430 feet), one of the major towns and district headquarters of western Bhutan. We continue our journey for another two hours before entering into the broad Phobjikha Valley (elevation 3,000 meters\/9,840 feet). The drive will be through a forest of rhododendron and oak, during which we will often encounter gigantic yak. This area is the chosen home of the rare black-necked crane, which migrates from the central Asiatic Plateau to avoid the harsh winters in that region. The opposite side of the pass overlooks a valley containing dwarf bamboo, the favorite food of the yak. We will visit the Gangtey Monastery, the only Nyingmapa monastery in western Bhutan and the home of the spiritual master known as ninth Gangtey Tulka. The monastery is surrounded by a large village inhabited mainly by families of the 140 gomchens who take care of the monastery. A picnic lunch will be served here. We will then hike down the natural trail to the hotel to experience one of the most beautiful valleys in Bhutan (approximately 1 \u00bd hours).\u00a0Day 6:\u00a0After breakfast, we will walk from the hotel to the Crane Information Center, where we will view a short documentary film on cranes and attempt to view them through a high-powered scope. We leave the Phobjikha Valley via a steady climb through semi-tropical vegetation to Pele la Pass (elevation 330 meters\/10,989 feet). With an alpine environment of rhododendron and dwarf bamboo, the pass is the dividing line between West and East Bhutan. When clear, it's possible to view several snow-covered peaks, including Mount Chomolhari (elevation 7,314 meters\/24,355 feet). We descend through dwarf bamboo and usually grazing yaks to the Chendebji Chorten. This chorten was built in the 18th\u00a0century by a Lama known as Shida to nail down the demon terrorizing this valley and the adjacent Ada valley. We will have lunch here. The drive continues toward Trongsa, passing the Trongsa Dzong next to the Mangde River (approximately 4 hours). We will stay at a resort hotel in Trongsa.Day 7:\u00a0Our day begins with a tour of the Trongsa Dzong, built in 1647 by Shubdrung Nawang Namgyal (\u201cThe Unifier\u201d). Many important historical events took place at this dzong in the making of modern Bhutan. After touring the dzong, we will hike up to the tower, which has been turned into a museum honoring the kings of Bhutan. We will have lunch and drive through the Yotongla Pass on our way to the Bumthang Valley. The first valley in the Bumthang region we encounter is Chumey, where we stop at a wool weaving factory at Tsungney village. For another hour, we continue our drive to the next valley (Chokhor valley). We will either stop and walk through the town for shopping, or head to our resort hotel.Day 8:\u00a0Our touring today begins at the Kurjey Lhakhang monastery, where it is believed that the 8th-century guru Padmasambhava meditated and subdued the local deity known as Shelging Karpo. We hike from here across a suspension bridge to Tamshing Lhakhang, founded at the beginning of the 16th\u00a0century by Saint Pema Lingpa. Next, we plan to visit the Konchogsum Lhakhang, built in the 8th\u00a0century. The temple is famous for its bell, which bears an inscription from the 8th\u00a0century.Day 9:\u00a0Today we drive to Ura, another valley in Bumthang at an elevation of 10,000 feet. We stop at Serthangla Pass, from where we hike downhill to the village of Ura. About 40 or 50 closely packed homes along cobblestone streets give the village a medieval atmosphere. We will plan to visit the temple at Ura, then drive back to our hotel in the Chokhor Valley.Day 10:\u00a0After breakfast, we will plan to hike up to the Peseling monastery and continue our walk up to the saddle of the hill. From the pass (11,000 feet), we will have a majestic view of the Tang valley. We continue our walk downhill toward Tang Membartsho (Burning Lake). We again overnight in our Bumthang hotel. (Approximately 5-6 hours.)Day 11:\u00a0We take our flight back to Thimphu and overnight in a hotel in the capital. We will have the afternoon off after arriving in Thimphu.Day 12:\u00a0After breakfast, we visit the Drukgyal Dzong, built in 1647 by Shubdrung Nawang Namgyal. The dzong was destroyed by fire and left in ruins as a reminder of the great victories that it was built to commemorate. On a clear day, one can see a magnificent view of Mount Chomolhari. We drive south to visit the Satsam Chorten, built in memory of Dilgo Khentse Rinpochey. We continue on to Kyichu Lhakhang, built in the 7th\u00a0century by a Tibetan king, Songtsen Gonpo. After lunch, we visit the National Museum of Bhutan, which contain works of art, handcrafts, costumes, armor, and rare stamps. We then take a leisurely hike down to Rimpung Dzong. We walk through a traditionally covered bridge and board our bus for a return to the hotel. If time permits, we will hike up a hill to obtain a view of the Paro valley.Day 13:\u00a0After breakfast, we will be driven to the start of the hike to the Taktsang monastery (Tiger\u2019s Lair). The trail climbs through beautiful pine forests, including many trees festooned with Spanish moss, and occasional groves of fluttering prayer flags. We will stop at a cafeteria for refreshments and lunch. We will then complete our hike to the monastery. The monastery was built in the 1600s and renovated in 2003. The monastery clings precariously to the edge of a sheer cliff over a rock face that is 900 meters above the valley below. The historical background of this monastery states that Guru Padmasambhava, the tantric mystic that brought Buddhism to Bhutan, flew here on the back of a flying tiger. We hike back down and return to our hotel.Day 14:\u00a0We drive to the Paro airport for our return flights.","leader1":"John Blaustein","leader2":"","leader3":""}},{"trip":{"title":"Top of Texas, Guadalupe Mountains National Park","id":"18304A","dates":"Oct 20, 2018 to Oct 27, 2018","destination":"United States, Texas","type":"Service\/Volunteer","group":"","difficulty":"3 (out of 5)","priceHigh":"535","priceLow":"535","image":{"src":"https:\/\/content.sierraclub.org\/outings\/sites\/content.sierraclub.org.outings\/files\/styles\/trip-teaser\/public\/trips\/main-images\/16291_1_JamesMoody.jpg?itok=1DoQ22VT","alt":""},"path":"\/outings\/texas-guadalupe-mountains-national-park#trip=18304A","overview":"The TripThe world's most perfect example of an exposed fossil reef lies -- of all places -- in the midst of the desert in West Texas, hundreds of miles from any present-day ocean. In the Permian Age, much of the western portion of the state was covered by a shallow sea. Technically, the Guadalupe Mountains are not a mountain range at all, but a massive coral reef now risen high above the surrounding plain by a geological uplift and the erosion of softer limestone layers above it. Today, despite adjacent expanses of sand and cactus, dry washes, and creosote, the mountain range itself remains a verdant island in the midst of the Chihuahuan Desert.As you climb ever upward in Texas' highest mountain range, you'll see ponderosa pine, bigtooth maple, Douglas fir, aspen, and many other varieties of tree, some not found anywhere else for hundreds of miles. The annual rainfall in the high country is twice that of the desert floor, but surface water is scarce at best, and nonexistent most of the time.McKittrick Canyon is a shining jewel of the desert. Called the most beautiful spot in Texas by many, it's a living textbook of geological diversity. As you walk beneath sheer white cliffs, notice the desert shrubs and cactus slowly give way to canyon woodlands, then to high country forest. Prickly pear, fern, the threatened Texas madrone (characterized by its distinctive orange bark and bright red berries), and pine trees somehow coexist within its unique ecology. Except in extreme drought, the canyon is ablaze with autumn color as leaves of orange, red, and yellow stand out in stark contrast against the evergreens and the towering white cliffs.The ProjectThere are more than 80 miles of trail in Guadalupe Mountains National Park, many of them devastated by a rash of flash flooding within the past few years. With only a small staff to maintain them, the National Park Service (NPS) has come to rely on volunteers as the core of its reconstruction efforts.Since 1999 when this trip initially ran we have partnered with the road and trails department staff at this national park on a variety of projects, principally trail maintenance. On several occasions we worked on trails that had been severely damaged by flash flooding and needed a good dose of rebuilding. Some years we\u2019ve had crews that took the \"high road,\u201d performing maintenance operations on the Guadalupe Peak Trail, the Permian Reef Trail, or the Tejas Trail. Other tasks include repainting the trim on the historic Ship On The Desert; brushing the top of the scenic Wilderness Ridge all the way to the New Mexico state line; and removing fencing and half-century old debris from a NPS site across the highway from the main portion of the park. Freezing weather and high winds cut out one work day one year but our crews still were able to erect split rail fencing in the campground and reconstruct a bad section of trail below El Capitan. We have also widened much of the McKittrick Canyon Trail and eliminated traces of work vehicles used in renovating the Pratt Cabin with a new stone roof. In addition, we tackled fence removal along the highway and other assorted projects to benefit the park.","highlights":"Work to preserve the park's trails, See a unique exposed fossil reef, Hike, explore the Chihuahuan Desert, or just relax","includes":"  All meals and lodging\/campsites,   Tools and instruction from the National Park Service,   Leader-led day hikes","itinerary":"Because of airline schedules and long distances by auto to the park, the trip leader will meet participants on Saturday.

The first work day is Monday and\u00a0will have us on the way to work between 7:30 and 8:00 a.m. Lunch will be packed at breakfast and eaten at the work site. Our work will consist of at least some of the following: removing large rocks from the trail; building or cleaning water control devices, such as water bars and check dams; re-grading the tread surface of the trail; cutting back vegetation; rerouting the trail where necessary; and erecting retaining walls.We'll receive more specific direction from the Trails and Roads crew who will assist us in this project. The NPS staff and the trip leader will also provide instruction to ensure that the trip is a safe one, as well as a productive one. Individual levels of experience can easily be accommodated because of the diversity of the work we'll be performing.Of the five weekdays, we'll work four and take one off. A variety of outings are possible on our free day, ranging from short, easy, walking hikes to more strenuous one-day excursions. Options include climbing Guadalupe Peak; hiking into McKittrick Canyon to view the fall foliage; hiking to Devil's Hall, an extremely narrow canyon with staircases to climb; or climbing into The Bowl for a taste of the high-country forest. Other hikes of varying lengths and difficulty levels are available. The trip leader has been on every trail in the park and can make suggestions for an enjoyable outing geared to your own\u00a0level of experience and conditioning. Group hikes are often led by staff members. Participants not familiar with the desert or the park often find these to be quite rewarding.At the end of the trip we'll clean up the National Park Service facilities we've utilized and pack away the Sierra Club equipment for use the following year. Then we'll be on our way.

We\u2019ll stay in the vibrant Old Quarter; visit the country\u2019s finest museums, gardens, and galleries; and discover unique retail shops and markets.\u00a0Sa Pa: Surrounded by soaring mountain peaks -- including the highest peak in the country -- Sa Pa is the perfect place to relax, enjoy the magnificent views, and hike among streams, waterfalls, and farm villages.Cat Ba and Nam Cat Islands: Cat Ba Island is the site of a national park that we will tour on foot and bike, and where will learn about the endangered Cat Ba Langur.\u00a0 A short boat ride away is the tiny island of Nam Cat, which sits at the confluence of Lan Ha Bay and Ha Long Bay. Our Nam Cat resort is a cluster of thatched wooden cabanas nestled between a soaring limestone cliff and the tranquil waters of the bay. Some cabanas are built over the water while others are set next to the brilliant white-sand beach.Ha Long Bay, a UNESCO World Heritage site, is among the most unforgettable places on the planet.

Although we'll be using the bus to travel on certain days, this trip has been designed to minimize bus travel and allow trip members to spend more time involved in outdoor activities and interacting with local Viet Namese and ethnic peoples. It is our goal to honor the spirit of sustainable tourism by hiring local vendors; patronizing smaller, locally owned hotels; eating locally sourced food; and following good environmental practices.Most of our meals will feature delicious Viet Namese cuisine; we'll also have some non-Viet Namese meals.

Established in 1893 as Pennsylvania\u2019s first state park, Valley Forge appropriately became part of the National Park Service in the bicentennial year, 1976.\u00a0This 3,500-acre park commemorates the third of eight winter encampments for George Washington and the Continental Army. At Valley Forge, Continental troops suffered from inadequate pay, food, and clothing, while approximately 1,700 to 2,000 soldiers died of epidemic disease. Just 22 miles away, the British occupied the former rebel capital of Philadelphia. Yet Valley Forge gave the Continental Army time to inoculate against smallpox.

Like O\u2019Keeffe, we will be able to peacefully immerse ourselves in the same spectacular geologic scenery of red mesas, deep arroyos, and striking mountains that surround the Ghost Ranch. Since 1939, this gorgeous remote area (encompassing over 21,000 acres) has been the backdrop for dozens of famous movies that were filmed here, including 'City Slickers,' 'No Country for Old Men,' 'The Missing,' and 'Wyatt Earp.' In addition, the Ghost Ranch houses two museums:\u00a0the Florence Hawley Ellis Museum of Anthropology\u00a0and\u00a0Ruth Hall Museum of Paleontology.

There she heard of Ghost Ranch and once even caught a tantalizing glimpse of it from a nearby high plain. In 1934 she finally found the ranch and immediately decided to live there. The Ghost Ranch gave her the freedom to paint what she saw and felt, and the Southwest landscape inspired her like nothing ever had before. Knowledgeable visitors can look around and identify many of the scenes she painted. Red and gray hills like those across from the roadside park south of the ranch headquarters were frequent subjects. Kitchen Mesa at the upper end of the valley is an example of the red and yellow cliffs she painted many times. Pedernal, the flat-topped mountain to the south, was probably her favorite subject. \u201cIt\u2019s my private mountain,\u201d she frequently said. \u201cGod told me if I painted it often enough I could have it.\u201d She spent the 50 years living in New Mexico until her death in 1986 at the age of 98.

This 5,000-square-foot Spanish Colonial-era compound and garden took four years to restore and was Miss O\u2019Keeffe\u2019s home and studio when she was not staying at the Ghost Ranch home during the summer months.Day 4:\u00a0After breakfast, we will take a guided Georgia O\u2019Keeffe Landscape van tour. Our tour guide will reveal the actual locations of O\u2019Keeffe painting sites by comparing prints of her paintings to the landforms in view, and share the story of her life at Ghost Ranch. After lunch we will have a free afternoon to relax, photograph, explore the Ghost Ranch library and museums, or hike the trails to nearby scenic vistas. After dinner, our archaeologist guide will preview tomorrow's trip to Chaco Canyon with a movie and discussion highlighting the ancient Puebloan astronomy in the Southwest.Day 5:\u00a0After breakfast we will depart the Ghost Ranch to begin our three-day van adventure to the archaeological jewels of the Four Corners region. Our first stop is Chaco Canyon National Historical Park. Construction of dozens of impressive \u201cGreat Houses\u201d began in the ninth century. These huge and well-preserved structures were often oriented to solar, lunar, and cardinal directions. Sophisticated astronomical markers, communication features, water control devices, and formal earthen mounds surrounded them. The buildings were placed within a landscape surrounded by sacred mountains, mesas, and shrines that still have deep spiritual meaning for their descendants. By 1050, Chaco\u2019s sphere of influence was extensive, as it had become the ceremonial, administrative, and commercial center of the San Juan Basin. Today the massive and well-preserved structures of the ancestral Pueblo peoples testify to organizational and engineering abilities not seen anywhere else in the American Southwest. After exploring Chaco Canyon, we will drive to Farmington, NM for lodging and dinner in town.Day 6:\u00a0Our next stop is an all-day tour of the Ute Tribal Park. Located adjacent Mesa Verde National Park, The Ute Park is the \u201cUn-Mesa Verde.\" Visitors have very intimate access to spectacular Anasazi cliff dwellings, artifacts, and rock art in an authentic place that feels as though it was just discovered. After exploring the Ute Tribal Park, we will drive to Cortez, CO for lodging and dinner.Day 7:\u00a0After breakfast, we will depart for Canyon de Chelly National Monument. Our scenic drive takes us through the Chuska Mountains into the Navaho Nation. From towering canyon rim overlooks we will see ancient ruins and geologic structures. \u00a0We will also take a hike into the Canyon to visit the White House ruins. During our visit, Martha will share the story of the Navaho people who have continuously inhabited Canyon de Chelly for centuries. After exploring the Canyon, we will drive to nearby Chinle AZ for lodging and dinner.Day 8:\u00a0After breakfast, we will leave for Albuquerque and say our goodbyes at the end of a memorable outing.\u00a0","leader1":"Donna Kurtz","leader2":"Melody Gross","leader3":""}},{"trip":{"title":"Backpacking the Grand Canyon: The Tanner-Escalante-Grandview Route, Arizona","id":"18138A","dates":"Oct 28, 2018 to Nov 3, 2018","destination":"United States, Arizona","type":"Backpack","group":"","difficulty":"4 (out of 5)","priceHigh":"1145","priceLow":"1145","image":{"src":"https:\/\/content.sierraclub.org\/outings\/sites\/content.sierraclub.org.outings\/files\/styles\/trip-teaser\/public\/trips\/main-images\/18138_main_ShellyEberly_0.jpg?itok=IHNHKNPb","alt":"Backpacking the Grand Canyon: The Tanner-Escalante-Grandview Route, Arizona"},"path":"\/outings\/backpacking-grand-canyon-tanner-escalante-grandview#trip=18138A","overview":"The TripPlease note: Because of Grand Canyon National Park rules, a backcountry permit cannot be applied for until June 1, 2018. Dates and\/or itinerary may have to be changed to obtain a permit. Final dates and itinerary should be solidified by early July 2018.Join experienced backpackers on a week-long backpack through the challenging, inspiring, and empowering Grand Canyon, rightfully one of the seven natural wonders of the world. The canyon may seem impressive when viewed from the rims. However, not until you drop below the rim, touch the Colorado River, experience a sunrise and sunset from the depths of the canyon, hear the hooting of owls nesting in the Coconino Layer, smell the wildflowers freshly in bloom, and slowly hike back out will you truly experience the magic and magnitude of this incredible canyon.Over 4.5 million people visit the South Rim each year, but only two percent dare to enter the Canyon\u2019s depths and spend the night. These are the lucky ones. Nearly two billion years of the planet\u2019s history is exposed in the Canyon\u2019s layers. During our Grand Canyon tours, we will explore and experience the geological and archaeological history of the canyon while admiring the animals and plants that live in this challenging environment. The leader will share her knowledge of backpacking, especially in the canyon, and her limitless passion for this natural treasure.The demands of the trip require very good physical conditioning. This is an absolute must for this trip. A flexible attitude and a sense of adventure are helpful and necessary traits, too. Due to the level of difficulty of this trip, recent (within the past year) backpacking experience is required to participate.During our Grand Canyon tour we will experience approximately 35 miles\u00a0of the Tanner, Escalante, Tonto, and Grandview trails. Distance covered each day will usually be five to six miles. Our planned route spreads the descent into the canyon across two days to reduce impact to our knees. Our ascent out of the canyon will be spread over three days, giving us opportunities to rest and explore.\u00a0We plan to travel at a moderate pace, taking pauses throughout to appreciate and relish this beautiful place.On a typical day, we will rise at 6:30 a.m., dine on a hearty breakfast, break camp, and be hiking by 8:30 a.m. We will strive to be at camp mid afternoon, with time to erect tents and clean up a little before dinner. However, some days may be long, meaning we may not get to camp until 5:00 p.m. or possibly later.The following is our itinerary for the week. Consider it an approximate as weather, the group\u2019s pace, and the National Park Service\u2019s permitting requirements may necessitate modifications.","highlights":"Backpack one of the Seven Wonders of the World, Take in views of the canyon from all sides, Experience backpacking across mesas, canyons, & beaches","includes":"  Learn backpack skills tailored to the Grand Canyon,   Tasty and hearty lightweight meals,   Group cooking gear provided","itinerary":"Pre-Trip:\u00a0The evening before the trip begins, we will meet in Grand Canyon Village to conduct our pre-trip orientation and distribute group gear.\u00a0Leader will provide guidance on lodging options and upon getting the permit will provide specific details on our meeting location.\u00a0(Dinner and lodging this evening are not included in trip price.)Day 1:\u00a0We will meet at 8 a.m. to caravan to our trailhead at Lipan Point, leaving a couple of cars at our exit trailhead. Finally, we will be off on our adventure, backpacking into the canyon four to five miles down approximately 2,000 feet.

After soaking our weary feet in the refreshingly cool river, we will begin our westward journey along the Escalante Route for three miles over undulating terrain to our camp along a quiet sandy beach. Total mileage is approximately seven miles -- four challenging downhill miles, followed by three rolling miles.Days 3-5:\u00a0For the next three days, we will continue west along the Escalante Route to Red Canyon, where we will pick up the Tonto Trail to Hance Creek. These 15 miles will take us through some terrain that our legs and eyes will find incredibly varying! Our trail will begin along the Colorado River, then it will climb steeply to a long traverse -- one that is sometimes narrow. The traverse ends at an incredible vista. We will drop into and climb out of several side canyons, one of which we will slowly meander down, giving us ample time to admire the blue and pink tones in the unusually shaped rocks that form its walls.At one place, near Papago Canyon, the Colorado River rushes against a rock outcrop. To bypass the outcrop, we will have to climb up a short rock face and then descend a rockslide. Slow and careful footwork will safely get us to the other side, but hearts will be pounding through this section. Once past this obstacle, we say goodbye to the Colorado River as we begin the steady climb to the Tonto Platform to our camp beside Hance Creek. During this climb, we will witness the beginning of the Inner Gorge: two-billion-year-old, sheer rock walls that plunge into the Colorado River. Eagle-eyed participants may spot desert bighorn sheep in this section, too.Day 6:\u00a0Today we continue to climb, covering three to four miles and gaining over 1,000 feet.\u00a0After setting up our camp on Horseshoe Mesa, a camp many may vote as their favorite, we will spend the afternoon exploring a multi-room cave, and roaming to the end of one or both arms of the mesa for beautiful views of the Inner Gorge.Day 7:\u00a0We have just three miles to cover this day, but they are all up -- 2,500 feet up. After arriving on the South Rim, we will retrieve our cars from the entry trailhead and then return to the Grand Canyon Village for a celebratory lunch. We likely will finish our lunch by 4:00 p.m. but please consider the potential for delays when making travel plans.","leader1":"Julie Vantilburg","leader2":"Shelly Eberly","leader3":""}},{"trip":{"title":"Marvelous Muleshoe Ranch Service, Galiuro Mountains, Arizona","id":"18305A","dates":"Oct 28, 2018 to Nov 3, 2018","destination":"United States, Arizona","type":"Service\/Volunteer","group":"","difficulty":"","priceHigh":"875","priceLow":"875","image":{"src":"https:\/\/content.sierraclub.org\/outings\/sites\/content.sierraclub.org.outings\/files\/styles\/trip-teaser\/public\/trips\/main-images\/16287_1_CharlesSchulz.jpg?itok=sGoxh2yc","alt":""},"path":"\/outings\/muleshoe-ranch-service-mountains-arizona#trip=18305A","overview":"The TripIn southeast Arizona, the great Sonoran desert and the Chihuahuan desert meet one another. Ancient sky islands with large undulating flat basins between them provide runoff to the streams and tributaries of the San Pedro River. The river is born in Mexico and flows north with life-sustaining water to produce one of the few remaining riparian areas in Arizona -- a sanctuary for year-round mountain and desert species, and a rest stop for migrating birds.The Muleshoe Ranch protects most of the watershed area for seven permanently flowing San Pedro tributaries, along with some of the best remaining native fish habitat in Arizona. Some 80 percent of the region's wildlife species -- including coatimundi, black bear, javalina, white tail and mule deer, mountain lion, and desert bighorn sheep -- depend on these desert streams.In the first half of the 20th century, the San Pedro River Valley was a quiet area of ranches and farms. Present-day population growth, urban sprawl, and the current short-sighted management of the region's water supply present significant challenges to the preservation of the San Pedro River riparian corridor and its animal inhabitants.The ProjectOver many years the Sierra Club has developed a great working relationship with the folks at the Muleshoe Ranch.

We will kayak the mystical Okefenokee Swamp by day as well as take a magical boat tour at night, when the glowing red eyes of alligators will look back at us as we shine our lights into the darkness. We will kayak a section of the scenic St. Marys River, where we will wind back and forth between the states of Florida and Georgia while searching the shoreline for birds and wildlife, as well as spring flowers in bloom. We will spend an entire day exploring the largest member of the Georgia Sea Islands, Cumberland Island, which stands as a grand testament to the power of preservation. The ferry boat ride to and from Cumberland Island is a thrill in itself, with dolphins often accompanying us on our journey.Our base for exploration will be Crooked River State Park, where we will stay in cozy cabins located on a bluff directly above the Crooked River. The sunrise on the river is amazing and a great sight to wake up to each morning. Nature trails wind through maritime forest and salt marsh, and hikers may see endangered gopher tortoises, fiddler crabs, herons, and other coastal birds. Crooked River State Park is located in St. Marys, Georgia, which is the gateway to spectacular Cumberland Island. Historic St. Marys' enchanting storybook setting on the St. Marys River beckons with white picket fences, charming Victorian inns, majestic magnolias, stately live oaks, fragrant salt air, alluring waters, and quaint shops. From the dock of the St. Marys Waterfront, we board the Cumberland Queen, which will take us on a 45-minute trip down the St. Marys River and across Cumberland Sound, landing on the backside of Cumberland Island. As a barrier island, Cumberland Island protects the mainland from erosion, provides habitat for animal and plant life, and renews one's spirit by displaying a rare and genuine beauty. The island has much to explore, including deserted beaches, sun-dappled maritime forests, shimmering freshwater lakes, golden marshes, and grand historic ruins. Wild horses wander all over the island, often crossing paths with visitors. Dolphins and other sea creatures can often be seen swimming in the waterways surrounding Cumberland Island, while fiddler crabs inhabit the marshes that dominate the backside of the island. Shore and migratory birds are present year round as well. Whether on land, sea, or air, wildlife is abundant!At the southern extremity of Georgia lies the largest swamp in North America, where a world of fascination awaits those who enter upon its dark, life-rich waters. A moody paradise of approximately 700 square miles, it is called Okefenokee, which means \u201cland of the trembling earth.\" This name comes from the floating islands of peat that are formed and the slowly colonized by grasses, shrubs, and trees. These peat islands tremble and quiver when a person walks upon them. Kayaking the Okefenokee in Georgia is an experience that you will remember for a lifetime. As we glide along on the water and dip our paddles in and out, alligators often also glide nearby us through the same tea-colored water. Herons and egrets wade through tall grasses and water lilies, while Florida cooters (turtles) sun themselves on fallen logs, plopping into the water if we approach too closely. The magic does not end at night. Dawn and dusk are prime wildlife viewing times. \u201cNight Magic\u201d occurs in the dark, as we hear a symphony of frogs, barred owls, insects, and even bellowing alligators fill the night sky with a chorus of sound. Not to be outdone, dancing fireflies and alligators staring back at us with glowing red eyes provide us a visual spectacle as well!While Okefenokee, Cumberland Island, St. Marys River, and the town of St. Marys can all\u00a0rightfully be called \u201cGeorgia Gems,\" we will also explore some \u201chidden gems\u201d such as the Crooked River, Fort Clinch, and some of the countless creeks and waterways that meander throughout this amazing area.

The wildly diverse ecosystems of the Galapagos Islands provide a haven for unique wildlife -- half of their species are found nowhere else. And the magic is, they are approachable by humans. Animals do not run off and birds do not fly away, likely due to a lack of natural predators -- a condition created by the very processes of evolution that first stirred Darwin to speculation in 1835. The Galapagos Islands are among the world\u2019s foremost wildlife preserves, providing us with unique and amazing experiences. Examples include the three-foot-long vegetarian marine iguana, the only known sea-feeding lizard on earth, and the Galapagos tortoise, which grows to six feet in length, weighs up to 600 pounds, and lives for at least 150 years! The archipelago also boasts colorful Sally Lightfoot crabs, sea lions, land iguanas, and lava lizards--EXPANDFROMHERE--. A prolific bird population includes frigate birds, penguins, boobies, tropicbirds, mocking birds, doves, albatross, hawks, gulls, cormorants, herons, warblers, flamingos, and the famous Darwin finches.Charles Darwin, of course, was the archipelago\u2019s most famous visitor. His chapter on the Galapagos in \u201cThe Voyage of the Beagle\u201d remains a classic, and is well worth reading. \u201cThe natural history of these islands is eminently curious\u201d he wrote, and with his collections of plants and animals, observations, and notes, he had sufficient material to support more than a quarter-century of research. Twenty-four years later, he published \u201cOn the Origin of Species.\" It shook the foundations of biological thought and led to profound changes in man\u2019s philosophy of nature.\u00a0Known as \u201cthe Enchanted Islands\" (named by Herman Melville, another early visitor), the Galapagos is a world-class destination! The swirling fogs that surround the islands at certain times of the year give rise to the legend that these were floating islands.On this trip we will stay at hotels on two inhabited Galapagos Islands: Santa Cruz and Isabela. Taking \u201cfast boats\u201d between Islands, we will have an opportunity to spot sea life such as sea birds, dolphins, sea turtles, rays, sea lions -- maybe even a whale. We will have the opportunity to snorkel to get a close look at the marine life. On land, we will observe the sere landscape with its fascinating geologic features, stroll in tropical rainforests, visit an active volcano (sporting the world\u2019s second-largest caldera), do some hiking or birding, or loll around at the beach. Our days will be filled with activity, but you'll also have the freedom to just relax. An English-speaking certified Galapagos naturalist will accompany us and help us understand the intricate relationships between plants, animals, people, and their environment.Santa Cruz Island (also known as Indefatigable) is the second-largest in the Galapagos. Wild Galapagos Tortoises roam free; flycatchers, Darwin's finches, and owls fill the forests; sea lions, marine iguanas, pelicans, and boobies abound. This island also has the largest human population within the island chain. We\u2019ll spend two nights in Puerto Ayora, the largest town in the Galapagos.Isabela Island (also known as Albermarle) is the largest in the Galapagos Archipelago. It was formed by the merger of six shield volcanos, including Volc\u00e1n Sierra Negra, which we will visit. We\u2019ll spend three nights close to the beach in the small town of Puerto Villamil, which will serve as our base for hiking and snorkeling adventures. Isabela is home to more wild tortoises than all the other islands.We will also visit Machu Picchu in Peru!\u00a0Machu Picchu is the site of an ancient Inca city, high in the Andes of Peru. Located at 8,000 feet above sea level, this UNESCO World Heritage site is often referred to as \"The Lost City of the Incas.\" It's one of the most familiar symbols of the Incan Empire and also one of the most famous and spectacular sets of ruins in the world. A visit to Peru would not be complete without visiting this treasure!It's no wonder Machu Picchu is Peru's most-visited site. Dating to the mid-1400s, it's a marvel of mortar-free limestone architecture perched on a high plateau deep in the Amazonian jungle. This citadel is considered one of the most extraordinary examples of landscape architecture in the world.The story of Machu Picchu is quite a remarkable one; it is still unknown exactly what the site was in terms of its place in Inca life. Current researchers tend to believe that Machu Picchu was a country resort for elite Incas. At any given time, there were no more than 750 people living at Machu Picchu, with far fewer than that during the rainy season. The Incas started building it around 1430 AD, but it was abandoned as an official site for the Inca rulers a hundred years later at the time of the Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire.One thing that is clear is that it was a remarkably well-hidden place, and well protected. Located high in the mountains of Peru, visitors had to travel up long valleys littered with Inca check points and watch towers. Remarkably, the Spanish conquistadors missed the site. These remarkable ruins became known to the scientific world in 1911, after the American archaeologist Hiram Bingham was led to the site by locals (he was on a trip sponsored by Yale University, actually looking for Vilacabamba, the last Inca hideout).\u00a0We also travel through the Sacred Valley to visit several other Inca sites such as Qorikancha, Sacsayhuaman (affectionally called \u201cSexy Woman\u201d), Ollantaytambo, and Pisac. These sites will give you better understanding of the incredible Inca culture and engineering accomplishments before our arrival in Machu Picchu.","highlights":"Explore world-renowned wildlife & ruin destinations, Lodge on Gal\u00e1pagos Islands, interact with locals, Tour the Sacred Valley of the Incas and Machu Picchu","includes":"  All meals, lodging, and on-trip transportation,   All admissions, entry fees, and gratuities,   Galapagos-certified naturalist, English-speaking guides","itinerary":"Day 1: Arrive in Guayaquil, a modern city and the major seaport of Ecuador.

We\u2019ll enjoy a lunch in the Highlands, then head to Puerto Ayora, where we will catch a \u201cfast boat\u201d for the transit to Isle Isabella. Our hotel is a short walk from the port, and we\u2019ll check in and relax over dinner.Day 4: Today we visit Volc\u00e1n Sierra Negra, one of the six volcanos that form Isle Isabela. We start at the Ranger Station, about a 45-minute drive (3,000 feet above sea level), and gain about 700 feet during our hike. At Volc\u00e1n Sierra Negra (elevation 3,688 feet), we will view the world\u2019s second-largest caldera -- 6 miles wide and 300 feet deep. We walk along the rim for a short while. On a clear day you get spectacular views. Then on Volc\u00e1n Chico, we can see volcanic activity as we observe the fumaroles. You will notice a shocking difference in the landscape -- from lush vegetation around Sierra Negra to the lava moon-scape area around Volcano Chico. Round trip is about 10 miles. We walk through several different climate zones along the route. There are points along the route to stop and wait for the more ambitious hikers if you chose. After a bit of hiking and a picnic lunch, we will return to Puerto Villamil to relax or hang out at the beach, enjoy the views and wildlife, and have dinner.\u00a0Day 5:\u00a0This morning visit Cabo Rosa, one of the best places to snorkel in the Galapagos. There are lava formations, lava bridges, and lava tunnels in the water that provide for a marine paradise in these crystal-clear waters. This is a good spot to look for the unique flightless cormorant, golden rays, sea lions, sea turtles, and penguins. As time allows, we'll further explore Puerto Villamil (population about 2,300), situated along a stunning expanse of white beaches. We may visit the lovely gardens at the Giant Turtle Center (Analdo Tupiza), where tortoises are protected in their first years of life before being released in the wild; or take a short walk to the nearby lagoon, where we might be rewarded with sightings of flamingos, ducks, and other water birds. This is our last night on Isabela.Day 6: We\u2019ll return by boat back to Santa Cruz Island this morning. We visit the Charles Darwin Research Station as time allows. Then in the afternoon we visit Tortuga Bay, one of the most stunning beaches in the Galapagos, accessible only by foot and home to hundreds of prehistoric-looking marine iguanas, blue-footed boobies, and pelicans. We\u2019ll even see turtle nesting sites. Dinner will be at a local restaurant.Day 7:\u00a0Today we have a boat excursion to North Seymore Island. We\u2019ll enjoy a relaxing lunch on this larger boat and enjoy a walk where we\u2019ll see abundant birds and other native species at close range, typically including blue footed boobies, frigate birds, land iguanas, and many other species of birds. Later in the day we will stop at the beach for another chance to snorkel in the clear waters.Day 8:\u00a0After breakfast at our hotel, we must go to the airport, bid farewell to our Island Paradise, and head back to Guayaquil. If time permits, we will be able to organize some activities such as taking a walk along the Malec\u00f3n (River Walk) to stretch our legs, visiting museums, or just relaxing at the hotel. Dinner tonight is at the hotel where we prepare to depart for Peru in the morning.Day 9:\u00a0On the move again! We depart for our international flights to the ancient city of Cusco, Peru, the former Inca capital. This flight is included in the trip price. We'll spend the remainder of the day catching our breath -- literally -- as we get used to Cusco\u2019s 11,200-foot altitude. This beautiful red-tile-roofed city was founded in the 12th-century by Manco Capac, the original Inca who was considered to be a child of the sun god himself. For almost 400 years, Cusco served as the flourishing capital of the Inca Empire and still retains its centuries-old appeal with numerous sections of original Inca stonework visible in the streets and buildings. Upon arrival, we will enjoy a walking tour near our hotel to see Qorikancha and the cathedral as time allows. Gentle walking helps to adjust to the altitude. We'll enjoy a relaxed dinner this evening at the hotel.\u00a0Day 10:\u00a0We have a morning departure for an amazing bus tour to the nearby Sacred Valley with its endless views and stunning archaeology. We visit Sacsayhuaman (also affectionally called \u201cSexy Woman\u201d) and the Indian Market of Pisac, which attracts people from remote communities dressed in colorful, traditional attire. This region (and the Pisac market) is well-known for high quality local crafts, including hand-knit wools, ceramics, leather goods, and jewelry. After a stop for lunch we continue by bus to Ollantaytambo, which features an extensive archaeological site located on the imposing hillside overlooking the town, containing structures such as the Temple of the Sun and the Royal Hall.From here we take a train (included) from Ollantaytambo to Aguas Calientes (also known as Machu Picchu Pueblo) where we will have dinner and spend two nights.Day 11:\u00a0A day in Machu Picchu! This will be a highlight. In the morning, we will have a relaxed schedule. We will have an hour tour of the Rock Sculptures along the river called Aguas Calientes, which flows into the Urubamba River. Our tour to Machu Picchu is in the afternoon, as mornings have a higher chance of overcast weather. We take a bus to the ruins, and start with a buffet lunch at the hotel there. Our knowledgeable guide will then give us a tour of the ruins, explaining the current theories regarding the purpose and significance of the city. After the tour you will have time to wander in this magnificent and sacred place -- maybe hiking to the Gate of the Sun (Intipunku) or the Inca Bridge. Many just take photos at their leisure of the ruins or the llamas that frequent this area. You can stay until 5 p.m. to enjoy the late-afternoon light on these unforgettable ruins, or you can opt to return to the hotel, enjoy the local hot springs baths (not included), or visit the markets. We have dinner tonight at our hotel.\u00a0Day 12:\u00a0After breakfast, the morning is unstructured. You may want to shop at the many local shops, visit the Butterfly Farm, take an extended hike, or just relax. You also have the option to return to Machu Picchu if permits are still available (but note that the cost of the permit and a second bus fare is not included). Lunch is at a local restaurant, then we take the afternoon train back to Cusco. This evening we are in for a treat: a cultural show with our farewell dinner that will have Peruvian dancers in complete costumes.\u00a0Day 13: Our trip ends after breakfast. You'll have the options of flying home, staying longer in Cusco, or visiting other places in beautiful Peru. We will say goodbye to our new Peruvian friends and reflect on the grand finale of our visit to Machu Picchu. Transfers will be provided to the airport on this day only.\u00a0Important notes:Occasionally, changes may occur in the trip -- either in advance or during the trip. Please be aware that we will make every attempt to stay within this itinerary. However, we may need to make changes for a variety of reasons (weather, equipment, Galapagos National Park Services, Peru Park Services, or other conditions, circumstances, or situations) to assure the safety and enjoyment of the entire group.

Folks driving in will be sent a map and directions to the lodge. We will then make our way (about 30 minutes) to our lodge. Once we settle in and introduce ourselves, we will tour the park and spring.Day 2:\u00a0After a wonderful breakfast, our group will head to the Wakulla River. At the put in, instructions will be given on the fundamentals of kayaking. Soon after, we will float down this extraordinary waterway. The source of the Wakulla River is Wakulla Springs. Because of the karst topography, the eastern part of Wakulla is filled with freshwater springs and circular groundwater-fed ponds and sinkholes--EXPANDFROMHERE--. Early inhabitants dubbed the springs \"strange and mysterious waters\" -- a seemingly accurate name because in some locations spring water appears somewhat magically from the ground, runs downstream for several yards, and then disappears mysteriously below the surface once again. Of the many beautiful clear water springs in the region, the most famous is Wakulla Springs. Wakulla Springs is one of the largest and deepest freshwater springs in the world. The spring flows up and out from an underground river at a rate of over 400,000 gallons per minute. Even at its deepest point of 185 feet, objects are sometimes visible near the bottom. As the spring water flows over land, it forms the equally clear Wakulla River.Day 3:\u00a0The Sopchoppy River originates in the wetlands of the Apalachicola National Forest west of Crawfordville in Wakulla County and runs 47 miles to the Ochlockonee River. Sixty percent of the blackwater river runs in the National Forest and St. Marks National Wildlife Refuge. It winds through dense forest, passes high sandy bluffs and limestone outcrops, and flows around white sandbars. The Florida National Scenic Trail follows the river for five miles between Oak Park Bridge and Bradwell Bay Wilderness Area. On past trips, people have always commented about how remote and wild this river feels. They also say it seems as if they were the first to ever paddle the river. Our group can expect to encounter the famous tupelo in full blooming splendor. The contrast of a huge, white, blooming canopy with flat blackwater is incredible.Day 4:\u00a0Today we paddle the Gulf. We start at white-sand beach and explore a shallow saltwater bay. This area is frequented by whooping cranes and mullet fishermen! After our paddle we head for San Marcos de Apalache Historic State Park. This is the site of the confluence of the Saint Marks and Wakulla rivers.Day 5:\u00a0The St. Marks River originates in the hardwood and cypress river swamps of the Red Hills area and flows 35 miles to the Apalachee Bay. The St. Marks River disappears underground at the historic site of Natural Bridge in Leon County and resurfaces a short distance south of the St. Marks Spring in Wakulla County. The St. Marks River joins the Wakulla River north of the bay at the San Marcos de Apalache Historic State Park. After our time on the river, we will make our way to St. Marks NWR. This is the home of abundant wildlife, especially birds. Last year our group spotted two bobcats, four whooping cranes, red cockaded woodpeckers, and numerous species of snakes. Wildflower lovers won't be disappointed because the deeper sloughs and ditches are filled with blooming irises, swamp lilies, arrow head, and coreopsis. The day's highlight will most likely be the gulf sunset viewed from the lighthouse.Day 6:\u00a0After breakfast, our group will head to the Wacissa River. Soon after we will float down one of the state's most pristine waterways. The Wacissa River is a clear, spring-fed river that originates in Jefferson County and flows 20 miles to the Gulf of Mexico. The 12 known springs are located in the upper 1.5 miles of the river. The river winds through swamps and marshes. A little ways past Goose Pasture is the Slave Canal. This canal was dug more than 170 years ago to transport cotton to the Gulf. In most people's opinion, this is Florida's premier wild river.Day 7:\u00a0By now most everyone will be in the routine of waking up, grabbing a cup of coffee, and taking a walk amongst state grand champion trees and a quick swim in the refreshing spring. Being our last day together, it's a good time to take a little bit longer to soak it all in -- it's been a long activity-packed week. At 9 a.m. we leave for the airport. The trip back to Tallahassee Regional Airport will take less than one hour.","leader1":"Patrick Nichols","leader2":"Holly Wenger","leader3":""}},{"trip":{"title":"Annapurna Sanctuary Lodge Trek, Nepal","id":"18730A","dates":"Nov 12, 2018 to Dec 1, 2018","destination":"Asia & the Pacific, Nepal","type":"International","group":"","difficulty":"","priceHigh":"3445","priceLow":"3445","image":{"src":"https:\/\/content.sierraclub.org\/outings\/sites\/content.sierraclub.org.outings\/files\/styles\/trip-teaser\/public\/trips\/main-images\/18730_9_Tom%20Miller.jpg?itok=4lefjj8D","alt":"Annapurna Sanctuary Lodge Trek, Nepal"},"path":"\/outings\/annapurna-sanctuary-lodge-trek-nepal#trip=18730A","overview":"The TripThe Himalaya are the highest and youngest mountain range on earth.

Israel presents a rich biodiversity of fauna and flora and is a wonderful country for birding, with a wide range of natural habitats, scenic landscapes, and, of course, endless human history, all in an area only as large as the state of New Jersey.Twice a year an amazing 500 million birds from 550 species fly over Israel. Half of those species are migrants. Our trip puts us in the path of the spectacular fall migration as the birds from Europe and northwestern Asia head south to their wintering grounds in Africa. Migrating birds generally prefer to fly over land, which allows them to use thermals to save energy. Israel\u2019s Mediterranean coast and Jordan River Valley have been described by some as \u201csuperhighways\u201d for birds. Excellent birding is virtually guaranteed as we visit some of Israel\u2019s most important birding areas: the Mediterranean coast, the Golan Heights, the Hula Valley, the Dead Sea, and the Negev desert--EXPANDFROMHERE--.We explore Israel\u2019s rich natural and human history by visiting Masada, a UNESCO World Heritage site by the Dead Sea, and spending a day in Jerusalem, where we learn about places that are sacred to all three Abrahamic religions. We will learn about other people in Israel as well, including the Palestinians, Bedouin, Druze, and Bahai.We stay in very comfortable hotels, including several nights in kibbutz inns with beautiful outdoor areas for relaxation and birdwatching.Our outfitter for this trip is the Israel Ornithological Center (IOC), a division of the Society for the Protection of Nature in Israel (SPNI).

After an orientation meeting, we drive to some sites along the Mediterranean coast. The area is dotted with large fishpond complexes that attract thousands of water birds, birds of prey, and more. We will focus on the area of Kibbutz Ma'agan Michael, birding at their vast fishponds. We will also take a birding stroll on the nearby beautiful Mediterranean beach. Later in the afternoon we head north to the Hula Nature Reserve. We finish the day exploring the boardwalks and extensive papyrus reed beds. Many birds of prey roost in the reserve and we have a very good chance of encountering mammals such as golden jackal, wild boar, and even jungle cat! We spend the night in comfortable cottages in a nearby kibbutz.Day 2: An early start before breakfast is required for the magical \"mobile hide\" tour at the Hula Agamon Park. This park is a magical refuge for tens of thousands of common cranes that winter here and dominate the landscape. These magical birds are what make the Hula what it is, and the sights, sounds, and mobile hide experience are unforgettable. Following breakfast we return to the Agamon Park. The park is the result of a fascinating story that begins with the drying of the historic Hula Lake and the problems that arose, which led to the reflooding of certain parts of the valley. It is a fascinating story and we will spend the whole day exploring the vast fields, fish ponds, and canals, including the reconstructed stretch of the Jordan River. At this time of year the area is full of greater spotted and E. imperial eagles, several white-tailed eagles, merlin, peregrine, pallid and hen harriers, long-legged buzzards and our newest breeding raptor the elegant black-winged kite. Overnight in the kibbutz.Day 3: Following breakfast we will head up to the Golan Heights and Mount Hermon. This mountain is the highest point in Israel (over 6,500 feet) and hosts many species that are found nowhere else. The area is fascinating both in terms of nature and, of course, geopolitical history. After exploring the mountain we descend and visit the Druze villages in the Golan. The Druze are a proud, fascinating people and we spend some time exploring their villages and have a Druze lunch. In the afternoon we visit a few more sites in the Golan Heights, including the \"valley of tears,\" which was the stage of the 1973 war between Israel and Syria and today overlooks the Syrian Golan. Overnight in the kibbutz.Day 4: Today we leave the Hula Valley and head south along the shores of the Sea of Galilee toward the Bet Shean Valley. This low-lying area is the last lush area for southbound migrant birds before the arid areas to the south. The reservoirs and fields here host thousands of wintering and migrant species as well as some local specialties such as Dead Sea sparrow, black francolin, and more. In the afternoon we head south along the Jordan Valley and climb up to a boutique hotel where we will spend the night in the hills above Jerusalem.Day 5: We start the day with a visit to the Jerusalem Bird Observatory. This bird observatory is one of Israel's most important urban birding centers and is the only banding station in the world that sits on a nation\u2019s parliament grounds! After the observatory, we meet a professional tour guide and spend the rest of the day exploring some of the major sites of Jerusalem. Since this is the night of the Sabbath, there will be options to experience a Sabbath meal at a Jerusalemite\u2019s home or to go to a local restaurant for dinner. Overnight at the same hotel in Jerusalem.Day 6: This morning we start with a deep breath and descend well below sea level to the Dead Sea. We spend the entire day around the marvelous Judean Desert and visit sites such as the famous Ein Gedi Reserve and the desert fortress of Masada, and we even take a dip in the Dead Sea, a must-try experience. Following a long day, we head south to the Negev where we will spend the night at a kibbutz guesthouse in the desert.Day 7: Today we head out to the fantastic Nizzana wilderness. We will search for the enigmatic Macqueen's bustard, several species of sandgrouse and the handsome desert race of little owl. The area is quite wild and also hosts mammals such as dorcas gazelle, Asian wild ass and even wolf and striped hyena (requiring serious luck). We spend most of the day in the Nizzana area and also visit the famous Nizzana Fortress, an impressive castle that dates back to Nabatean times. Overnight at the kibbutz guesthouse.Day 8: This day in the Negev desert includes sightseeing, birding, and some hiking. We will visit the Avdat gorge, an amazing canyon with large springs that holds water year round. The area is home to impressive herds of ibex and hosts several pairs of griffon vultures. Following the hike we visit the community of Sde Boker and hear about David Ben Gurion, the first Prime Minister of Israel. Overnight at the kibbutz guesthouse.Day 9: This morning we start our journey south to Eilat on the Red Sea. We drive through the fantastic Ramon Crater and visit a couple of interesting spots to learn about the amazing geology of this endemic machtesh (non-impact crater). We stop for some birding along the way and eventually arrive in Eilat in the afternoon. In the evening we visit the Eilat North Beach. Tonight\u2019s lodging is in a kibbutz lodge just north of the Red Sea.Day 10: Today is a day of birdwatching and scenery around Eilat. We head up to the Eilat Mountains where we visit the Eilat Birdwatching Park and the famous salt pans north of the city. The salt pans host impressive numbers of water birds, including a large flock of flamingos. In the afternoon, we visit some of the southern beaches, including the Dolphin Reef Beach in the Coral Beach Reserve, which is famous for its snorkeling. Overnight in the kibbutz lodge.Day 11: Our final day in Eilat is focused on visiting desert sites around Eilat. We visit the famous Amram's pillars (a unique geological site in the Eilat Mountains) and reserves such as Ein Evrona, the Acacia Gazelle reserve, and Eilat\u2019s North Beach. Tonight we enjoy our farewell dinner and stay at a seaside hotel in Eilat.Day 12: Following breakfast we say our goodbyes to our fellow travelers. Our trip is complete and we will take home fond memories. Participants are welcome to fly back to the Tel Aviv airport for a flight home, stay in Eilat, or spend a day in Petra, Jordan.The trip leader will be happy to suggest itineraries for anyone who is interested in arriving in Israel before our trip or staying in Israel after our trip is finished.

In fact, this treasure chest has a full 50 percent of its species found nowhere else. \u00a0And the magic is, they are approachable by humans. Animals do not run off and birds do not fly away, due to their isolation from natural predators. Especially unusual is the three-foot-long vegetarian marine iguana, the only known sea-feeding lizard on earth. The Gal\u00e1pagos tortoise grows to six feet in length, weighs up to 600 pounds, and lives up to 150 years! The archipelago also boasts colorful Sally Lightfoot Crabs, sea lions, land iguanas, and lava lizards. A prolific bird population includes frigate birds, penguins, boobies, tropicbirds, mocking birds, doves, albatross, hawks, gulls, cormorants, herons, warblers, flamingos, and the world famous Darwin finches--EXPANDFROMHERE--.Darwin, of course, was the archipelago\u2019s most famous visitor. \u00a0He had sufficient material to support more than a quarter-century of research. When he published the classic The Origin of Species it shook the foundations of biological thought and led to profound changes in man\u2019s philosophy of nature. Time permitting, we will visit the Darwin Research Center on the island of Santa Cruz, where we will be staying a few days. Darwin wasn\u2019t the only one to find inspiration in the Gal\u00e1pagos. \u00a0During the whaling era, Herman Melville made landfall here, and he perpetuated the sailor\u2019s nickname: \u201cThe Enchanted Isles.\" The swirling fogs that surround the islands at certain times of the year give rise to the legend that these were floating islands.We will be visiting both inhabited and uninhabited Islands in the Gal\u00e1pagos. By taking \u201cfast boats\u201d between some Islands, sometimes you can spot sea life such as sea birds, dolphins, sea turtles, rays, sea lions\u2014maybe even a whale. Because much of the unique life of the Gal\u00e1pagos is below water, the opportunity to snorkel a few times to get a close look at the marine life will be a highlight. On land, we will observe the sere landscape with its fascinating geologic features, stroll in tropical rain forests, visit an active volcano, hike to the world\u2019s second-largest caldera, do some other hiking, birding, or lull around at the beach. Our days will be filled with activity but you'll also have the freedom to just relax. An English-speaking, certified Gal\u00e1pagos naturalist will accompany us and help us understand the amazing relationships between plants, animals, people, and their environment.After the\u00a0Gal\u00e1pagos, we visit a cloud forest outside Quito and enjoy the prolific bird population, as well as go on some hikes and marvel at the beautiful scenery. \u00a0We are there for a few nights, then move on to Quito for the treasures that made this area a UNESCO World Heritage site. In Quito, we tour the old colonial area, visit \u201cMitad del Mundo\u201d (The Middle of the World), and stand on the equator! If time and schedule permit, we may attempt to attend the National Folkloric Ballet Jacchigua. This program consists of cultural dances, not the kind of ballet that we are familiar with. This is a spectacular Ecuadorian experience.On our visits to Guayaquil (Ecuador\u2019s largest city and sea port), the cloud forest, and Quito (a World Heritage site), English-speaking guides will accompany us.

We may choose Heritage Park, Island Santay, the Malecon (River Walk), or one of the many other options in this area. The leader will work out the details closer to the trip departure. This will give us a relaxing day to recover from jet lag. To take advantage of this day, please plan to arrive in Guayaquil at least a day early.Day 2: At breakfast we will get acquainted and have a short orientation meeting. Then we will begin our adventure with a short tour of Guayaquil highlights and a visit to the cocoa plantation and factory. There we will learn about growing cocao and the production of chocolate. We will also have the opportunity to purchase some of the chocolate made on the premises. That evening, we will enjoy our welcome dinner.Day 3: On to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands! The flight to and from the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands is included in the trip price. Tickets for this flight will be issued to you at the Guayaquil Airport before we leave for the islands. We arrive at the Baltra airport and are met by our certified Gal\u00e1pagos naturalist guide. We will take a short bus ride to the highlands, a virtual cloud forest, to look for giant tortoises in the wild. We will enjoy lunch here. On our short walk through a rain forest environment, we might catch a glimpse of the spectacular vermillion flycatcher! On to check into our hotel and enjoy dinner at a local restaurant.Day 4: On the move again! We will proceed to Puerto Villamil on Isabela Island, the largest Island in the archipelago, via a fast boat. After hotel check in, we explore Puerto Villamil, situated along a stunning expanse of white beaches. We will visit the lovely gardens at the Giant Turtle Center (Amaldo Tupiza) where tortoises are protected in their early years before being released in the wild. We will take a short walk to a fantastic lagoon where it is not uncommon to see flamingos strut and marine iguanas pose.Day 5: Today we visit two of Isabela\u2019s six volcanos. At Volcano Sierra Negra, we will view the world\u2019s second-largest intact caldera. This day is our most difficult hike of the trip. Our elevation gain is only 1,000 feet, but we do go over some rocky terrain and dirt sections. We take it slowly and discuss the birds, flora, and fauna along the way. Once on the top, enjoy your picnic lunch. Then on to Volcano Chico; we can tell it is an active volcano from noticing the fumaroles. The landscape changes dramatically in the short distance between the two volcanos. We return to Puerto Villamil after this accomplishment and enjoy dinner.Day 6: At Cabo Rosa, we will snorkel to observe the diverse marine life and see lava tunnels in the water. This is a good spot to look for sea lions, sea turtles, and penguins! In the afternoon, we have several options. This is a free afternoon. You can enjoy our fabulous hotel on the waterfront and go for a swim there, read a book, or walk to \u201ctown\u201d and interact with the local people. Those ambitious may want to walk to Concha y Perla via a wooden pathway. In the mangroves and rocks there is a small colony of sea lions that use the place to rest. You can pick your activity (or no activity) at the time. This is our last night on Isabella Island, and everyone loves having the flexible afternoon here.Day 7: After breakfast, we return to Santa Cruz Island and get settled back in our hotel. We have a box lunch; you may enjoy it at the hotel or bring it with you on our next adventure. \u00a0We will walk to Tortuga Bay, only accessible by foot. We can relax and enjoy one of the most stunning expanses of white beach in the\u00a0Gal\u00e1pagos --\u00a0home to hundreds of prehistoric-looking marine iguanas, blue-footed boobies, and pelicans. Time permitting, we will visit the Charles Darwin Research Station with its collection of giant tortoises from all of the islands. This was where the famous Lonesome George resided after being found. He was the last remaining giant tortoise from the Island of Pinta. Unfortunately, Lonesome George passed away in May 2012, and in 2017 was brought back to be displayed in a climate-controlled building. Here we will learn what scientists from around the world are doing, together with the Gal\u00e1pagos National Park and Marine Preserve, to keep \u201cThe Enchanted Isles\u201d pristine and ecologically viable.Day 8: Today we board a small boat for the day. We go to North Seymour. Our main focus will be on birds -- where they court, mate, build nests, lay eggs, and then rear their chicks. It is a bevy of activity. This excursion includes a stop and stroll at Las Bachas Beach where you may see flamingos in the lagoons and sea turtles just off the beach. This is where we will have the opportunity to snorkel in the clear waters. \u00a0Lunch is on board the yacht dedicated to our group. \u00a0Day 9: After breakfast at our hotel, we must depart for the airport and bid farewell to our Island Paradise. We fly to Quito in the highlands and go directly from the airport to the spectacular Bellavista Cloud Forest. This area is one of the most biodiverse areas in the world. It is a 2,000-acre reserve located at an elevation of 4,600 to 8,500 feet, with steep slopes and an abundance of epiphytes, bromeliads, orchids, and birds. The owners are recognized as pioneers in sustainable ecotourism in the region. This is a birding paradise: tanager-finch, giant antpitta, plate-billed mountain-toucan, toucan barbet, and 14 species of hummingbirds. The cloud forest is a different type of rain forest, a mysterious enchanted forest with a much more benign climate than the Amazon Basin, and no malaria. We stay overnight here.Day 10: Today we spend the entire day at Bellavista Cloud Forest Reserve, where we will enjoy a guided bird walk as well as do some hikes in the area. We may hike to Hidden Falls, and enjoy the sites along the way. We will enjoy the excellent home-cooked Ecuadorian and international food, the beautiful views, and the serenity of the small resort nestled in the mountains. We stay here again tonight.Day 11: After a morning hike in the cloud forest among the birds, flora, and fauna, we depart our little paradise. On our way to Quito, we head for \u201cMitad del Mundo\u201d (The Middle of the World), where we will stand on the equator. We visit a small museum that encourages you to participate in different experiments to prove you are standing on the actual equator line. Dinner will be in Quito, where we stay overnight.Day 12: Today we will have a tour of colonial Quito, the capital of Ecuador and a World Heritage site. We visit several of the well-known cathedrals, one laced in gold! The afternoon will be free. You can visit the local Artesian Market for famous Ecuadorian handcraft, or a museum. Our farewell dinner will be at a local restaurant in Quito.Day 13: We bid goodbye to this wonderfully diverse country and its people, at least for now.

From its rainforests and dense vegetation, its pristine beaches, volcanoes, high mountains, and marshy lowlands, Costa Rica is a favorite among nature lovers and adventure seekers.This trip focuses on the southernmost, remote peninsula of Osa and the southwestern Pacific coast of Costa Rica, which are relatively undiscovered by tourism and development. We\u2019ll engage in a variety of outdoor activities and search for the elusive quetzal, toucans, tapirs, monkeys, scarlet macaw, and a diverse array of animal and plant species.Costa Rica is smaller than West Virginia, yet it hosts an astonishing share of the world's biodiversity. While this tiny nation is only 0.25 percent of the world\u2019s landmass, it contains as much as 6 percent of the world\u2019s plant and animal species, including the endangered jaguar, many species of monkeys, tapirs, sloths, turtles, brightly colored macaws and toucans, poison dart frogs, and red eyed tree frogs. It hosts 1,239 species of butterflies, 838 species of birds, 440 species of reptiles and amphibians, 232 species of mammals, and 1,500 species of orchids. Recognizing the value of ecotourism, Costa Rica dedicated 2 percent of the country as national parks and protected area.We get off the beaten path to visit such treasures as Corcovado National Park in the Osa Peninsula, Savegre canyon and Poas Volcano National Park, and Ballena Marine National Park. We'll spend our days viewing a diversity of wildlife with a naturalist guide on early morning bird walks and hikes through cloud and rain forests in primary and secondary forests. We\u2019ll also engage in outdoor activities, including kayaking, snorkeling, and river boating. You\u2019ll also have time for relaxing on pristine beaches and in our unique lodgings.We travel comfortably by private mini-bus and enjoy a diversity of scenery along the way.

In the evening, we'll get to know each other over a welcome dinner.Days 2-3:\u00a0(Coffee Plantation in Santa Maria de Dota) After breakfast, we'll visit a coffee plantation in Santa Maria de Dota and enjoy a tour of the plantation and the coffee mill. Following lunch at a local restaurant, we drive south to the misty and beautiful cloud forest in the Talamanca mountain range, which boasts the highest peaks in Central America. Our mountain retreat is set at an elevation of 7,200 feet, so nights here can be chilly, but our lodge will be warm and comfortable. It is beautifully situated along the river in the Savegre canyon. You\u2019ll have time to explore the beautiful grounds and relax before dinner.This valley is a prime viewing spot for the beautiful but elusive quetzal, so we\u2019ll start the next day with some early-morning bird watching, which should reward us with sightings of the quetzal, tropical warblers, collared trogons, many hummingbirds, and any of 200 other species.Here we will hike to a waterfall and\/or hike through the oak cloud forest above the lodge at 8,000 feet. There will be time to relax in the quiet gardens of our mountain resort or treat yourself in the lodge\u2019s spa (not included in the trip price).Days 4-6:\u00a0(Osa Peninsula) Following breakfast, we follow the InterAmerican Highway south, climbing to the 10,600-foot Cerro del Muerte, high above timberline. We'll stop briefly to learn about the paramo highland scrub and tussock fields, a unique ecosystem found only here and in the Andes of South America. We continue south to our destination of the remote lowland tropical rainforest of the Osa Peninsula.Owing to its isolation, biological diversity, and large areas of old-growth forest, the Osa Peninsula is one of Costa Rica's most important, but still largely undiscovered, natural areas. Here we are surrounded by the rainforest, and just outside your room are the magical sounds and sights of this amazing and complex environment. During our time here, we\u2019ll kayak the mangrove environment of the Golfo Dulce, seeing many species endemic to the mangrove, with time to relax at the beach and swim in the ocean.During one day of our stay, we will take a rugged drive and boat trip to Drake Bay and hike in Corcovado National Park, the only remaining old-growth wet forest on the Pacific coast of Central America. There are 13 major ecosystems here, including lowland rainforest, highland cloud forest, yolillo palm forest, and mangrove swamps, as well as coastal marine and beach habitats. We will hike and swim, and may spy some anteaters, crocs, and small, beautiful (and venomous) frogs. There may also be the opportunity to see tapirs, peccaries, margay and the tracks of the illusive jaguar.After our stay in the ecolodge, we\u2019ll head north to an attractive eco-lodge on a private reserve overlooking the Pacific coastline, where we will be welcomed for the next three nights.Days 7-9:\u00a0(Ballena Marine National Park) Our accommodations and open-air dining room overlook the beautiful coast of Ballena Marine National Park. This is one of Costa Rica's newest parks, dedicated to protecting nesting grounds for brown boobies, frigate birds, and ibises.

And the best feature is that Mount Kilimanjaro is a broad shield volcano, which requires no technical skills to climb -- just excellent conditioning and an excitement for remote, exotic locations. Its famous snow cap is visible from over a hundred miles away, but climate change is quickly shrinking Kilimanjaro's glaciers; experts believe the snows will be gone within just a few decades.

The local staff of cooks, porters, and guides carry our gear, cook the meals, and set up and take down our tents, leaving you free to contemplate and enjoy this magical place--EXPANDFROMHERE--.Our local guides have extensive training and experience in getting people acclimatized. They will escort us for eight days along the Lemosho Route, preferred because of its low traffic, high summit success rate, and beautiful scenery. We\u2019ll pass through four distinct climate zones: beginning at 6,500 feet in lush rain forest, we\u2019ll quickly pass into the giant heather and moorlands zone with its sparse vegetation of giant senecio trees and lobelia plants. Climbing higher into alpine desert, we\u2019ll marvel at the colossal boulders, dry, barren expanses, and scant plant life. And finally as we approach the summit, there is the frigid beauty of disappearing glaciers shimmering in the early rays of sunrise in the arctic zone. From there, you will reach the awe-inspiring Uhuru Peak and the \u201croof of Africa.\u201d A rapid descent on the last day and a half gets us back in time for a swim at the hotel before preparing for the safari, the perfect way to decompress from the hard trek up Kilimanjaro.A quarter of Tanzania's land is set aside in national parks and preserves. Surrounding Kilimanjaro are a series of national parks that contain some of the densest concentrations of wild animals in Africa. Swapping trekking for safari clothes, we\u2019ll drive through Tarangire National Park with its herds of wildebeest, zebra, elephant, and giraffe thriving along its permanent river. Then we\u2019re off to Tanzania's lush, subtropical Serengeti plains to ride open-topped Land Cruisers and spot and photograph thousands of wildebeest, zebras, and gazelles, and their accompanying predators. After a full day in the Serengeti, we move on to Ngorongoro Crater to marvel at black rhino, lion, leopard, cheetah, and various antelope. Finally, there is Lake Manyara National Park with its famous tree-climbing lions, flashy lakeside flamingoes, and variety of entertaining monkeys.It will be difficult to know whether to photograph the baboon's playful antics, or watch through binoculars as lions and hyena devour a kill, or list all the species we'll be seeing -- often at the same time! We will spend each night in \"wild camps,\" which have spacious tents with beds and en-suite facilities where we can hear the sounds of the bush and be part of this wild world.During our travels, we will learn about the cultures of Tanzania's many ethnic groups and how they have historically co-existed with their environment.Tanzania's true treasure is the warmth and hospitality of its people.

All meals today are at our hotel.Day 3: (Moshi-Lemosho Glades-Mkubwa Camp) We will shuttle from the hotel to Londorossi Gate: check in, meet our trekking staff, and collect our gear. Then we're in for an exhilarating ride on a primitive road to Lemosho Glades at 6,500 feet to begin our trek. We will hike at a slow, steady pace up 2,500 feet in three hours through montane forest to our first camp at Mti Mkubwa (big tree) at 9,000 feet.Day 4: (Mkubwa Camp-Shira Camp 1) We will move up and out of the forest nearly 2,500 feet in five hours into the giant heather moorland at 11,500 feet to Shira Camp 1. Often cloudy, this area is characterized by cool dampness. After a couple hours of rest in camp, we will take a short hike up a nearby ridge to aid in our acclimatization.Day 5: (Shira Camp 1-Shira Camp 2) Our hike will be a gradual climb of 1,100 feet for 3-4 hours up the Shira Plateau along a moorland meadow to Shira Camp 2 at 12,600 feet. The giant senecio trees come into view today. We will take another acclimatization hike before dinner. When the clouds clear, Kili is in plain view and exhibits some fine evening alpenglow.Day 6: (Shira Camp 2-Barranco Camp) Today is a long but scenic hike up 2,600 feet to the base of the Western Breach and the foot of the Lava Tower at 15,200 feet, a remnant of Kili's volcanic past. We will then descend 2,200 feet down the Barranco Valley through groves of senecio trees and lobelias to Barranco Camp at 13,000 feet; a total of seven hours. This scenic camp is situated below the Western Breach and Great Barranco Wall, which we will climb tomorrow. Great views of Kili draped with glaciers, Mt. Meru, and the possibility of a memorable sunset on the Breach and Barranco Wall await us today.Day 7: (Barranco Camp-Karanga Camp) The excitement today begins with the two-hour hand-over-hand climb up the Barranco Wall with amazing views the whole way. We will top out just below the beautiful Heim Glacier before descending into a steep canyon. We then begin climbing up to Karanga Camp at 13,800 feet, a climb of about a thousand feet over four hours. Remnant jagged peaks of Mawenzi -- an older, eroded volcano -- jut into the African sky. After a couple hours of rest, another acclimatization hike up a nearby ridge gives us a view of our next camp.Day 8: (Karanga Camp-High Camp) We hike to our high camp in alpine desert terrain above tree-line. Climbing over a couple of ridges, we join the exit trail, going up 2,000 feet in four hours past crowded Barafu Camp to our private, comfortable camp at 15,800 feet. This camp gives us an hour's head start up to the summit. The afternoon is spent preparing for our summit climb and getting some much needed sleep. It's off to bed after an early dinner.Day 9: (High Camp-Uhuru Peak-Millenium Camp) Summit Day! Awake about 11:30 p.m., bundle up in warm clothes, down some hot tea and cookies, then begin the climb. Slowly (\u2018pole-pole\u2019), we'll make sunrise at Stella Point at 18,650 feet, the end of the steep climb. After a short break, continue more gradually to the highest point at Uhuru Peak, 19,341 feet. After summit photos, we head back to High Camp. Although the ascent may take 6-7 hours, we'll be able to glissade down fine scree in about three hours. After lunch and a short nap, we\u2019ll descend 3,300 feet in three hours to Millenium Camp, beautifully situated in the cloud forest at 12,500 feet.Day 10: (Millenium Camp-Mweka Gate-Moshi) We'll make our final descent of 7,000 feet to Mweka Gate in five hours through cloud forest on a trail that is sometimes slippery. Then we only have a short drive back to the hotel, to reach our lunch and hot showers. The afternoon is free for swimming and preparing for the safari. Dinner is at the hotel.Day 11: (Moshi-Tarangire National Park-Highview Hotel) We drive about four hours to reach Tarangire National Park, where migratory animals congregate at the permanent waters of the Tarangire River in the shade of baobab trees. Herds of gazelle, hartebeest, wildebeest, zebra, elephant, eland, and oryx crowd the lagoons. Accommodations and dinner are at the modern, comfortable Highview Hotel.Day 12: (Highview Hotel-Olduvai Gorge-Serengeti National Park) Our busy day starts with a visit to Dr. Frank's medical facility in Karatu. Expanding his staff and facility every year, he's brought trusted health care to the Maasai and local people. Moving on, we'll lunch at Olduvai Gorge where interpreters show us the famous sites of the Leakey's archaeological discoveries. By late afternoon we enter Serengeti National Park for our first game drive to seek out wildebeest, zebras, lions, and cape buffalo. We arrive at sunset to Serengeti Wild Camp, a luxurious, impermanent tented camp featuring comfortable beds, en-suite facilities, large screened windows, and patio chairs to view wandering giraffe or hear growling lions. We stay two nights here to enjoy the nocturnal sounds of the bush.Day 13: (Serengeti National Park) We will leave camp early to enjoy the dawn light and higher activity level of the predators. In the Serengeti, the earth's largest concentration of plains wildlife still roams free. Expect to see lion, cheetah, leopard, hyena, elephant, hippo, warthog, and cape buffalo. We will return to camp for midday lunch while the animals are resting in the heat of the day. A late-afternoon game drive will find the predators and prey active once again. Near sunset, we return to Serengeti Wild Camp for dinner.Day 14: (Serengeti National Park-Ngorongoro Crater-Highview Hotel) After an early morning game drive, depart for Ngorongoro Crater, a UNESCO World Heritage site -- 2,000 feet deep and the largest intact crater in the world (100 square miles). We'll picnic near bathing hippos and spend the afternoon finding leopard, cheetah, hyena, jackal, black rhino, and the magnificent black-maned lions. Birds are also abundant, including pink flamingo, ostrich, Kori bustard, hornbill, and the beautiful grey-crowned crane with its unique headdress. You'll be surprised how close we can get to all these animals in our vehicles. In the evening, we return for another night at the Highview Hotel.Day 15: (Highview Hotel-Lake Manyara National Park-Moshi) We will have an early morning arrival at Lake Manyara National Park to see the famous tree-climbing lions, elephant families tending to their babies, fluorescent flocks of pink flamingoes, and the humorous antics of playful baboons.

Our dinner will be at a local paladar, a family-style restaurant.Days 3 and 4: (Vinales and Surrounding Area)We leave Havana early in the morning and head out to the unique Cuban countryside with its farms, stone houses and royal palms. On our way, we will see little vehicle traffic, as only 38 of 1000 Cubans own cars (compared to 800 out of 1000 in the US). Instead, we will see horse-drawn carts, walkers, hitch-hikers, and buses. We will stop along the way at prime birding locations, stopping at Las Terrazas, a model community known for its sustainable practices and ecotourism. We will look for Cuba\u2019s national bird, the Cuban Trogon, as well as the Cuban Tody, Cuban green woodpecker, and others. Over the course of the two days in this area we will visit La Guira National Park, a 54,000-acre mountain wilderness with picturesque valleys and hidden caves.\u00a0 It is home to many birds, including the Cuban solitaire, white-winged dove, yellow-faced grassquit, black-whiskered vireo, Cuban bullfinch, Cuban peewee, and Western spindalis. This area also includes a limestone cave where Che Guevara headquartered during the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962.\u00a0We will spend two nights in scenic Vinales, a picturesque small town surrounded by tobacco farms and the uniquely-shaped mogotes. If time permits, we will visit one of the tobacco farms just outside of Vinales. We will stay at casa particulares, where it is easy to interact with the locals and where the owners serve a hearty breakfast.Days 5-7: (Zapata)This morning we will head to the Zapata area, which has more than 900 species of flora, consisting of a mosaic of scrub, dry forest, swamp, mangrove, coastline, and mudflats with over 200 species of birds. It is part of the Zapata Biosphere Reserve, the largest protected area in the Caribbean and the best-preserved wetlands in all of the Antilles, totaling over one million acres. It is a \u201cWetland of International Importance,\u201d designated by the Ramsar Convention. We will look for Cuban blackbird, Cuban oriole, and the Cuban emerald, and make a good effort during our time in Zapata to find the difficult-to-see Zapata wren and sparrow.\u00a0We will bird the Bermejas Reserve in the Zapata region, with a good chance at blue-headed quail-dove, grey-headed quail-dove, and the Key West quail-dove. We will also look for Cuban parakeet, Cuban pygmy owl, Cuban woodpecker, Fernandina\u2019s flicker, and the bee hummingbird -- the world\u2019s smallest bird. Other possibles are Greater Antillean nightjar, tawny-shouldered blackbird, and bare-legged owl. Our meals will be at a variety of interesting restaurants with meals featuring fresh seafood and traditional Cuban cuisine, and we will stay at casa particulares.While in the Zapata region, we will visit the great swamp, where we can see flamingos, numerous species of herons, and many other charismatic birds including warblers and terns. On our days here we will search for the elusive Zapata wren and Zapata sparrow. We will spend time at the Las Salinas del Brito Fauna Reserve, known for its mangrove swamps, coastal lagoons, and woods with 165 species of indigenous and migratory birds, , mammals, reptiles, amphibians, fish, and invertebrates. We can expect flamingos, roseate spoonbills, glossy and white ibis, herons, pelicans, snail kite, Cuban black hawk, and others.Day 8: (Trinidad and Cienfuegos Botanical Gardens)We leave Zapata, making a stop in Bermejas, and head to Cienfuegos Botanical Gardens. We spend the afternoon in Trinidad, an especially scenic colonial city known for its beauty and history of sugar wealth. As time permits, we will bird this area, looking for the Cuban gnatcatcher, the Cuban nightjar and the yellow-headed warbler.Days 9 and 10 (Cayo Coco)In the morning, we stop at Tunas de Zaza, then have lunch at the station. During this time we hope to meet some young Cuban students at a small school, where we can talk, through our guide, about how they are protecting their rich envorinment. The last trip, we also offered donations of school supplies, field guides and coloring books of the birds of Cuba to the school.In the coastal area of Cayo Coco and Cayo Guillermo, we search the flats and shores for terns, flamingos, waterfowl and other birds. If time allows, we will visit the Cuban Center for Coastal Ecosystem Studies, El Baga National Park.\u00a0We cross a 17-mile causeway to Cayo Coco. These islands are located within an archipelago called Jardines de Rey (King\u2019s Gardens). In the fall of 2017, Hurricane Irma inflicted much damage on the area and much of the area\u2019s trees were damaged. We will see how the area is recovering, while looking for the Oriente warbler, thick-billed vireo, Bahama mockingbird, Cuban gnatcatcher, mangrove cuckoo and a variety of waterbirds, including magnificent frigatebird, anhinga, tricolored heron, roseate spoonbill, and perhaps the secretive, non-migratory West Indian whistling-duck.We should also have some extra time to relax at our resort hotel.Day 11: (Havana)We return to Havana, and enjoy a city walk if time allows, and a farewell supper to talk over our favorite moments on the trip.Day 12: (Havana)Trip ends after breakfast and transfers to the airport.","leader1":"Kevin Breen","leader2":"","leader3":""}},{"trip":{"title":"Rebuilding a Village in Earthquake-Damaged Nepal","id":"19535A","dates":"Feb 6, 2019 to Feb 24, 2019","destination":"Asia & the Pacific, Nepal","type":"International","group":"","difficulty":"","priceHigh":"4295","priceLow":"4295","image":{"src":"https:\/\/content.sierraclub.org\/outings\/sites\/content.sierraclub.org.outings\/files\/styles\/trip-teaser\/public\/trips\/main-images\/19535_1_SteveVeit.jpg?itok=WnRjRV_s","alt":"Rebuilding a Village in Earthquake-Damaged Nepal"},"path":"\/outings\/earthquake-rebuild-village-nepal-service#trip=19535A","overview":"The TripThis trip is not the usual Himalayan sightseeing adventure. It\u2019s a special opportunity to help Nepali villagers whose homes and possessions were destroyed in the devastating earthquakes of April and May 2015 to rebuild and reconstruct their homes. The twin earthquakes constituted a tragedy of almost unimaginable scale for Nepal; thousands of lives were lost, and hundreds of thousands of buildings were damaged or destroyed. The people of the world responded in many ways to help Nepal rebuild, sending volunteers, money, food, medicine, and materials to aid in the effort. This trip, our second service project visit to Nepal, is only one small part of that larger and still ongoing effort, but it provides a way for you to help in the most direct way possible, by being there and working alongside the Nepali people to turn compassion into action, and by demonstrating that although healing the world is a big job, one person can make a difference--EXPANDFROMHERE--.The village at the focus of this project is Badel, a small, off-the-grid rural settlement in the Khotang district of the Himalayan Middle Hills, about 42 air miles south of Mount Everest. Badel village is home to about 1,500 people, including many of the guides and porters who have supported our Sierra Club Himalayan treks over the past 35 years. We\u2019ll head east from Kathmandu in Land Cruisers for two days -- spending the first night in a lodge at Halesi, and on the second day reaching the end of the road at Aiselukharka. From there we will trek for one day to reach the village of Badel, where we\u2019ll work for a week under professional supervision alongside local residents to rebuild and reconstruct at least one damaged home.\u00a0 After our week of work, we\u2019ll trek for two days, leaving Badel on a different trail, which will bring us to the small regional airport at Lamidanda. From there, a 45-minute flight returns us to Kathmandu. For the two nights before our time in Khotang and the three nights after, we\u2019ll stay in a Kathmandu hotel convenient to shops, sights, and restaurants. All meals and accommodations on the entire trip are included in the trip price.Nepal is a country of peaceful and hospitable people, colorful bazaars, decorated temples, and great natural beauty. Having endured political instability in recent decades, Nepal has transformed itself from a monarchy into a federal parliamentary republic. The Kathmandu Valley is a microcosm of the country. Its three major cities -- Kathmandu, Patan, and Bhaktapur -- are a melting pot of many tribal, ethnic, and religious groups.This trip involves hiking, living, and working at moderate altitudes for an extended period of time and should therefore be considered moderately strenuous. This trip is appropriate for strong, healthy individuals with good hiking skills who are open to traveling in a developing country, and who have enthusiasm and stamina for helping with the rebuilding project.The ProjectThe service project will involve a range of construction activities, all conducted under professional supervision. No specific previous construction experience is required, although to enjoy this trip it\u2019s fair to say that you should be comfortable working with your hands and learning new skills. Using simple hand tools, you\u2019ll transform rocks, wood, sand, re-bar, concrete, gravel and mud into habitable and safe dwellings. Many of the homes destroyed or badly damaged in the 2015 earthquakes were constructed of unreinforced stacked stone. Our project will use new building practices designed to resist earthquake damage, and our work will be directed by an expert engineer to ensure the reconstruction is consistent with government-approved design guidelines.\u00a0Although this project has been scheduled for February 2019, which is almost four years after the April and May 2015 earthquakes, there will still be plenty of work for our group to do. The scale of the devastation was so great, and the damage so widespread, that the reconstruction process will extend for at least several more years, especially in these relatively remote villages beyond the end of the road and reachable only by trail or helicopter.","highlights":"Experience Himalayan culture and village life, Help rebuild the homes of our staff and other villagers, Enjoy scenic trekking and Kathmandu Valley sightseeing","includes":"  In-country transportation, all meals, tips, and fees,   All hotels, lodges, and tenting accommodations,   Local trekking crew, cooks, and professional supplies","itinerary":"Please note that this itinerary involves extended travel in mountainous terrain and is subject to change prior to or during the trip to accommodate weather conditions, participant ability and health concerns, safety concerns, or other circumstances that may arise.Day 1: You will be met at the Kathmandu airport (4,400 feet) and taken to our comfortable, well-located hotel in the Thamel district. The trip officially begins in the afternoon with a visit to Boudhanath, one of the largest stupas in the world, accompanied by a professional cultural guide. Dinner will be at a nearby restaurant.Day 2: A morning of guided sightseeing in the Kathmandu Valley, visiting the sacred Hindu temple sites of Pashupatinath and Budhanikantha. After lunch we\u2019ll return to our hotel, where we\u2019ll have the afternoon to relax, pack our duffel bags, and prepare for our departure the next day. Dinner will be at a neighborhood restaurant near the hotel.Day 3:\u00a0In the early morning, we load into our SUVs (four participants per vehicle) heading eastward on the BP Koirala Highway. This is the main road to Tibet, built by the Japanese in 2015. At Dhulikhel, we leave the Tibet highway and descend slowly to the Roshi river. The drive continues for awhile along the river and then slowly ascends to Halesi (4,500 feet). Although the total mileage for the day is around 140 miles, all on completely paved roads, it will take about six to seven hours. Dinner and overnight will be at a lodge in Halesi.Day 4:\u00a0Halesi (also known as Halesi Mahadev) is a popular pilgrimage site for both Buddhists and Hindus. The main shrine is in a cave reached by climbing down several flights of stairs (100 feet or so). There are other holy caves around the main shrine. So, before continuing our drive eastward this morning, if we\u2019re fortunate to be granted permission we\u2019ll visit the shrines. We\u2019ll only cover approximately 50 miles in the SUVs today, but because it\u2019s all on rough, unpaved track, it will probably take us about seven hours to reach our destination of Aiselukharka (2,750 feet) at the end of the road. The rest of our crew will meet us there and set up camp for our first night in tents.\u00a0 During this portion of the trip, we\u2019ll be camping and traveling with staff -- including guides, porters, and cooks, who will prepare all of our meals.\u00a0Day 5: After meeting our porters and seeing them set off with our duffels, we\u2019ll have breakfast and then start hiking toward Badel village (6,400 feet). It will be about an eight-hour hike, mainly uphill (the net elevation gain is about 3,650 feet). We\u2019ll pass through forests, villages and fields, enjoying the vistas and stopping along the way for lunch.\u00a0 On arriving in Badel we\u2019ll be warmly welcomed by the villagers, and we\u2019ll see that our tent camp, which will be our home base for the next week, has already been set up for us.\u00a0Day 6: This day is planned as a \u2018relaxation and orientation day,' to explore the Badel area, meet the villagers (in particular those whose homes we will be rebuilding) and hear their stories, visit the school and meet the teachers, and begin to feel at home in our new surroundings.Days 7-9: We\u2019ll work on the rebuilding projects -- carrying rocks, making gravel, digging foundations, mixing mud, pouring cement, setting re-bar and fitting framing -- basically doing whatever needs to be done -- all under kind and patient professional supervision. Everyone will work at his\/her own pace and within his\/her comfort limits. We\u2019ll work together as a team, with an emphasis on having fun while accomplishing useful work.\u00a0Day 10: On this planned day off from our labors, we'll make a longer visit to the school (some participants may enjoy collaborating with one of the instructors to help teach classes in their area of interest or expertise), accept invitations to homes of staff and other friends, or perhaps hike to ridge tops through the thick forests, bird watch, or learn about healing from the local shaman.Days 11-13: It\u2019s back to work for the next three days. It will be a joy to see progress as the house (or houses) grow and take shape. We\u2019ll begin to realize that our work is really having an impact.\u00a0Day 14:\u00a0Today, we'll begin our two-day return trek through the fields and forests, heading generally downhill toward the airstrip at Lamidanda. Today\u2019s up-and-down hike, taking us to our camp at the halfway point of Tapkhola village, will take approximately six hours.Day 15: Another six hours of trekking will bring us to Lamidanda (4,100 feet), where we\u2019ll make camp and prepare for the next day\u2019s morning return flight to Kathmandu.Day 16: We\u2019ll board our plane for the 45-minute flight back to Kathmandu, which will be an urban culture shock after our time in the peaceful village of Badel. We\u2019ll be able to relax at our hotel, and have free time to explore the neighborhood restaurants and shops. Group dinner together at the hotel.Day 17: Assuming our flight from Lamidanda was on schedule the day before, we\u2019ll visit the ancient UNESCO World Heritage city of Patan with our knowledgeable sightseeing guide. After touring Patan\u2019s Durbar Square and extraordinary museum, we\u2019ll have lunch and then return to the hotel, followed by a few hours of free time until dinner at a nearby restaurant.Day 18: This morning our sightseeing guide will accompany us to Changu Narayan, the oldest Hindu temple in Nepal. We\u2019ll then have a walking tour of nearby peaceful and almost medieval Bhaktapur, where we\u2019ll have lunch before returning to our hotel. We\u2019ll have a few hours on our own for shopping or exploring before our farewell dinner at one of the better restaurants in town.Day 19: The trip officially ends after breakfast, as we depart the hotel for Kathmandu airport and our return flights home, leaving Nepal with memories of a lifetime. Transportation to the airport is provided.","leader1":"Cheryl Parkins","leader2":"Steven Veit","leader3":""}},{"trip":{"title":"Devilish Tasmania: Australia's Wilderness Wonderland","id":"19540A","dates":"Feb 9, 2019 to Feb 20, 2019","destination":"","type":"International","group":"","difficulty":"","priceHigh":"5445","priceLow":"5445","image":{"src":"https:\/\/content.sierraclub.org\/outings\/sites\/content.sierraclub.org.outings\/files\/styles\/trip-teaser\/public\/trips\/main-images\/18830_5_DanLeighton.jpg?itok=Nv1grYMa","alt":""},"path":"\/outings\/devilish-tasmania-cradle-mountain-wombats-wild-coasts-australia#trip=19540A","overview":"The TripTasmania! The very name conjures images of the other side of the world. This wild island lies off the southern coast of the Australian mainland. Home to aborigines and former penal colonies, it now preserves a vast array of endemic wildlife and a near pristine World Heritage wilderness. We\u2019ll explore sandy beaches (including Wineglass Bay, considered one of the 10 most beautiful beaches in the world), high mountains (Cradle Mountain is the second-tallest and most dramatic on the island), the cool temperate rainforest, and the rugged, rocky northwest coast. Besides hiking throughout the spectacular scenery, we will spend time kayaking, cruising on the Pieman River, and looking for opportunities to spot some of the unique wild animals of Australia.At 26,376 square miles, Tasmania is about the same area as West Virginia and is both the 26th largest island in the world and the smallest state of Australia. Nearly half of its 500,000 citizens live in the capital and largest city, Hobart. \u00a0When the land bridge connecting it to the continent disappeared some 10,000 years ago, it was left isolated with the aborigines, their culture, and the flora and fauna present at that time. These have maintained their separate identity from the mainland ever since, with much less change than on the mainland.\u00a0Some of the unique flora and fauna of Tasmania include wallabies, pademelon, Huon Pine, echidna, black cockatoos, Tasmanian blue gum, platypus, quoll, wedge tailed eagle, swift parrot, King Billy Pine, waratah, many varieties of eucalypts, and of course, the Tasmanian devil.\u00a0After meeting in Hobart on the morning of day one,\u00a0we head north to the Tasman Peninsular where we spend two nights visiting the Port Arthur Historic site, taking a wilderness cruise, and hiking the spectacular coast. This is followed by two nights at Coles Bay where we will explore the\u00a0expansive beaches of Freycinet National Park, including Wineglass Bay.We then head north and west, starting with a visit to Apsley Gorge\u00a0to hike in the nearby dry eucalypt forest and an\u00a0overnight in Launceston, Tasmania's second-largest city.The following day we'll pass through Sheffield, famous for the murals on many of its buildings, and then spend two nights at Cradle Mountain National Park and hike in its alpine setting. Scenic Dove Lake and a possible walk up Cradle Mountain itself are on the schedule.Our next two nights will be in Corinna, an abandoned mining town now converted into an ecologically sensitive resort. This stay allows us the opportunity to cruise downriver on the Pieman River to the Indian Ocean and walk along the rugged, rocky northwest coastline.\u00a0We then proceed south to the beautiful Lake Saint Clair National Park for more hiking and a stay at the lovely Lake Saint Clair Lodge. \u00a0The trip then comes to a close with our return to Launceston for our last night on this magical island.","highlights":"Experience Tasmania's beaches, coastlines & mountains, Meet wombats, echidna, wallabies & Tasmanian devils, Cruise the Pieman River to hike Tasmania's west coast","includes":"  All lodging in hotels & cabins,   All meals & all gratuities,   On-trip transportation & local expert guides","itinerary":"Note the following is the planned itinerary, but like any adventure trip, local conditions and unforeseen events may require us to adapt our plans as we travel.Day 1: The trip begins with a mid-morning orientation meeting. We\u2019ll then enjoy lunch in Hobart and immediately board our chartered van and travel to the Tasman Peninsula. We\u2019ll have time in the afternoon to hike to Waterfall Bay, after which we\u2019ll settle into our lodging for a 2-night stay. (Walking: 2-3 miles, 2 hours. Driving: ~2 hours.)Day 2: After breakfast, we take a short drive to the Port Arthur Historic Site. Part of the Australia Convicts World Heritage Site, Port Arthur was the original penal colony in Tasmania. Our tour by an onsite guide will provide fascinating insight into its unique history, and time is allocated after the tour to explore this beautiful site and learn about its terrible past.\u00a0After lunch, we\u2019ll head out on the water for a 3-hour wilderness cruise. We\u2019ll see the highest vertical sea cliffs in the Southern Hemisphere at Cape Pillar, as well as waterfalls, exotic rock formations, archways, and deep-sea caves. And along the rugged coastline -- part of the Tasman National Park -- we will potentially see seals, whales, and thousands of sea birds, including diving gannets, albatross, sea eagles, cormorants, and peregrine. After the cruise, we\u2019ll return for dinner at our lodging. (Walking: ~2-3 miles, ~2-3 hours. Cruise: 3 hours.)Day 3: We\u2019ll begin the day with a drive to the town of Coles Bay, the main entrance point to Freycinet National Park. Time permitting, we\u2019ll take a short hike after arriving, and then head out for an afternoon kayak on the clear waters of Great Oyster Bay, where the views will afford us a completely different perspective of Freycinet\u2019s pink granite mountains, which rise straight from the sea. After kayaking, we\u2019ll check into our lodging in Coles Bay and enjoy dinner. (Walking: 2 miles, 1 hour. Kayaking: 3 hours.)Day 4: Today we walk to the turquoise waters and perfectly circular beach of Wineglass Bay, considered by many to be among the most beautiful beaches in the world. A wide sweep of white sand frames the deep blue waters of the bay. Continuing, we come to Hazards Beach and then to the Lemana Lookout. Along the way, we may see Bennet's Wallaby, Tasmanian pademelon, wombat, green rosella, black cockatoo, and swift parrot. Time and weather permitting, a short swim at Hazards Beach is also an option. (Walking: 7 miles, ~5 hours.)Day 5: The day starts with a short drive north to Douglas-Apsley National Park to explore the Apsley Gorge and visit one of Tasmania\u2019s few largely uncut dry eucalypt forest areas. Then after lunch we\u2019ll head to Launceston, Tasmania\u2019s second-largest city. After checking into our lodging we\u2019ll explore Cataract Canyon -- literally a canyon in the city -- and dine at the Gorge Restaurant. Walking back to our lodging at the base of Cataract Canyon after dinner, we\u2019ll likely see pademelon and other wildlife coming out to feed in the early evening. (Walking: 5-6 miles, ~5 hours. Driving: ~3 hours.)Day 6: We\u2019ll aim for an early start this morning as we head to Tasmania\u2019s central highlands. After a brief break in Sheffield, the \u201cTown of Murals,\" we\u2019ll arrive at Cradle Mountain National Park. We can enjoy the beautiful Dove Lake and, for those who prefer a more strenuous stretch, explore the Twisted Lakes loop walk. During the walk our guides will introduce this spectacular region with descriptions of its history, pioneers, and prehistoric plant life while we enjoy the impressive views of Cradle Mountain and Dove Lake. (Walking: 7 miles, ~5 hours. Driving: ~ 3 hours.)Day 7: Conditions permitting, those who wish can attempt the challenging ascent of Cradle Mountain (5,068 feet). The trail is about 7 miles long, ascending and descending 2,400 feet. This optional hike will take about 8 hours. For those not interested, or if the weather is not good enough, there are several less strenuous options, including visits to waterfalls, to Crater Lake, or through areas of dense button grass and eucalyptus. In the evening, we\u2019ll visit the Devils at Cradle Tasmanian Devil sanctuary. (Walking: 5-8 miles, all day depending on selected hikes.)Day 8: This morning we will pack our belongings and begin our journey west. \u00a0We will make a short stop in the historic mining town of Waratah and then get a first look at the dense, fern-filled Tarkine rainforest on a hike to Philosophers Falls. Another hour\u2019s drive will bring us to Corinna where, weather permitting, we\u2019ll hike to the summit of Mount Donaldson with spectacular views into the heart of the Tarkine. After the hike we\u2019ll check into our sustainable guest lodging for two nights in the former mining community of Corinna. (Walking: 5-6 miles, 5 hours. Driving: 2 \u00bd hours.)Day 9: With the mist rising over the Pieman River, we\u2019ll have an early-morning start for a 90-minute cruise downstream aboard the Arcadia II. After being dropped off at the river\u2019s mouth, we\u2019ll spend the morning exploring the area and taking in the wild west coast. After returning upstream to Corinna, there are options for canoeing on the river or taking one of several short walks. (Walking 4 miles, ~4 hours.)Day 10: After breakfast we leave Corinna and head into the Franklin-Gordon Wild Rivers National Park, a remote and rugged area shaped by ancient glaciers. During the day we\u2019ll select from a variety of short walks to explore this diverse wilderness. \u00a0In the late afternoon we\u2019ll check in at the beautiful and eco-friendly Lake Saint Clair Lodge. (Walking: 2-4 miles, ~3 hours. Driving: ~3\u00bd hours.)Day 11: Today we\u2019ll explore the area within Lake Saint Clair National Park with either a hike to Shadow Lake and the Summit of Mt. Rufus (weather permitting) or a hike to Echo Point and along Cynthia Bay. \u00a0Near the end of the day we\u2019ll re-board the bus and head north to our lodging and final night in Launceston.

There are 4,000 years of history here. This is where the Buddha wrestled with the meaning of suffering and the way to enlightenment; where for eons Hindus have sought unity with God through reincarnation; and where the Moghul Muslims constructed the perfect edifice, the Taj Mahal. This ever-changing, yet timeless, place challenges all of your senses, greeting you with ornately carved temples; fakirs on beds of nails; sacred cows; gleaming marble palaces from bygone eras; snake charmers; and the hustle-bustle of streets teeming with rickshaws and bicycles. India is a country of striking contrasts, and the diversity of its natural history easily matches the grandeur of its civilization. For many years Africa has been regarded as the ultimate continent for wildlife viewing; the world is beginning to realize, however, that India's range of wildlife rivals that of the famous African game parks--EXPANDFROMHERE--.Forests and fauna with a wide variety of trees, plants, and animals are found throughout the entire subcontinent in various reserves, natural parks, and areas fortunate enough to have escaped the crush of overpopulation. Here, we will look for Bengal tigers, leopards, and other smaller cats, along with the Asian elephant, the Indian rhinoceros, many primates and antelopes, and a variety of deer and bovine species. Also, with close to 1,200 recorded species of birds, India alone holds roughly 12 percent of the world's avifauna population. Finally, there are more than 400 reptile species in India and numerous fascinating invertebrates.During our whirlwind swing through this ancient land we'll focus primarily on India's magnificent wildlife. We will also explore the country's history, beliefs, customs, and architectural treasures, such as the Taj Mahal, along the way.Our journey focuses on central India, where we will experience some of the best cultural and natural history sites in the states of Uttar Pradesh (Agra), Rajasthan (Ranthambore), and Jim Corbett NP in the Nainital district of Uttarakhand.\u00a0We'll start in Delhi, exploring both the old and new city with its rich history and ancient monuments. From Delhi we will drive to the Jim Corbett National Park, located in the foothills of the Himalayas. Home to a variety of flora and fauna, it is famous for its wild population of tigers, leopards and elephants. Corbett is India's oldest and most prestigious national park, and also the first sanctuary to come under Project Tiger, launched in 1973, to protect the endangered Royal Bengal Tigers of India.After three days at Corbett, we drive to ancient Garhmukteshwar and Fort Uchagoan (mentioned in Hinduism\u2019s ancient Mahabharata). The next morning our journey continues to Agra to marvel at one of the wonders of the world -\u2013 the Taj Mahal. Words hardly do justice to the Taj, which seldom fails to move those who see it. From Agra, we'll drive to Bharatpur and the Keoladeo Bird Sanctuary, developed by the Maharajas of Bharatpur in the late 19th century as their private hunting sanctuary.The next day we catch a train from Bharatpur to Ranthambore National Park, famous for its tigers and the World Heritage Site of Ranthambore Fort, founded around A.D. 880. After three days exploring Ranthambore, we drive to Jaipur and visit the glorious City Palace with its traditional Rajasthan and Mughal architecture, as well as the adjacent astronomical Observatory, Jantar Mantar, built in 1728 and now a World Heritage Site monument. After breakfast the next morning we will visit the Amber Fort, built in the 17th century.We\u2019ll then catch a flight back to Delhi and prepare for our journey home.This trip is suitable for adults who enjoy nature, adventure, and cultural exploration. The sites on our itinerary are nowhere near border areas and provinces in which unrest (very occasionally) occurs. We will travel by bus, rail, and SUVs, with one train ride -- a real treat given the history of the Indian national railway system! We'll stay in first-class hotels and comfortable jungle lodges.We plan to see as much as possible of India's incredible wildlife -- much of which is endangered -- and immerse ourselves in the country's rich cultural history. We will also explore Indian conservation, political, and religious issues, and discuss the ways in which they contribute to overpopulation. Finally, we will have an excellent opportunity to observe tigers in their natural state and to understand the Indian subcontinent's complex ecosystem.","highlights":"Spend six days in wildlife preserves, Immerse yourself in India's melting pot of cultures, Marvel at the Taj Mahal and Agra Fort","includes":"  All meals, lodging, and gratuities,   Professional guide service,   All on-trip transportation","itinerary":"Day 1: All participants should arrive at the Indira Gandhi International Airport today and transfer to our hotel in New Delhi.

Overnight in Delhi.Day 3: After breakfast, we will drive (approximately 6-7 hours)\u00a0to Kumeria and transfer to The Den, our lodge.Day 4: After breakfast we will drive (approximately 1\u00bd hours) to the Dhikala Forest Rest House in the Jim Corbett National Park. Dhikala, situated at the border of the extensive Patil Dun valley, is the most popular destination in Corbett because of its superb location and sheer abundance of wildlife present. Along the way we will be birding. If you love bird watching then Corbett is a virtual haven for you. Corbett, and its adjoining area, is home to more than 650 species of residents and migratory birds. In the evening we will have a game ride by Jeep in the national park.Day 5: We will have Jeep game rides in the Jim Corbett National Park.Day 6: Our best opportunity to see much wildlife will be on our early morning elephant rides. In the afternoon we have Jeep game rides again.\u00a0Day 7: After breakfast we drive (approximately 4\u00bd hours)\u00a0to Garhmukteshwar and transfer to Fort Uchagoan.Day 8: Today we drive (approximately 4\u00bd hours) to Agra, site of the Taj Mahal. In the afternoon we will visit the Agra Fort, which, like the Taj, is also a UNESCO World Heritage site. Reportedly, the Shah spent his last years thinking of his deceased wife while gazing out at the Taj from the Fort, where one of his sons had imprisoned him. We will also visit the Mehtab Bagh, a 25-acre garden constructed from A.D. 1631-1635. Known as the \u201cMoonlight Garden,\u201d it is laid across the western side of the river Yamuna and aligned with the Taj Mahal. It is considered the ideal location for viewing the perfect beauty of the Taj under the moonlight. Overnight Agra.Day 9: We will arise early for an unforgettable sunrise visit to the Taj Mahal, where the sun turns the white marble of the mausoleum a beautiful rose color. One of the wonders of the world, in the 17th century, Shah Jahan commissioned this remarkable building as a permanent resting place for his favorite wife, Empress Mumtaz Mahal. Though it took a workforce of some 20,000 men from all over Asia 21 years to build the Taj, the effort appears to have been worth it. Tagore, the Bengali classical poet and literary giant, described the Shah's project as a \"dream in marble\" and \"a tear on the face of eternity.\" And while its architectural layout has a distinct Islamic theme -- representing paradise -- the Taj is really more of a monument to undying romantic love. After leaving Agra we will drive to Bharatpur (2 hours), where we will enjoy afternoon birding by rickshaw at the Keoladeo National Park Bird Sanctuary, where a string of lakes attracts great numbers of waterfowl. It is also an excellent place to watch mammals such as the golden jackal, striped hyena, fishing cat, sambar, blackbuck and wild boar. Overnight will be in Bharatpur.Day 10: After an early breakfast we will catch the train to Ranthambore (three hours), where we will spend the next three days on game rides with time allowed for a hike up to the exotic, mysterious Ranthambore Fort. Thought to have been built around 880 to 935 AD, the Raja Sajraj Veer Singh Nagil commanded an army of 20,000 warriors from the fort to protect the kingdom from the powerful Rajput kings of Rajasthan. On our safaris through Ranthambore, we will be surrounded by the Vindhya and Aravali hill ranges, located near the outer fringes of the Thar Desert, and we will travel through the best of the desert land as well as the plains area near the hills. Along the way, we will look for tigers, jackal, mongoose, sloth bear, and the elusive leopard, along with a myriad of birds that inhabit this area. Overnight accommodations will be in Ranthambore.Days 11-12:\u00a0We will enjoy morning and afternoon game rides by canter\/Jeep.Day 13: After breakfast we will drive (approximately 3 1\/2 hours) to Jaipur. In the afternoon we will visit the City Palace and Observatory. The City Palace is an imposing blend of traditional Rajasthan and Mughal architecture. The vast palace complex occupies one seventh of the walled city of Jaipur. Originally built by Maharaja Jai Singh, additions have been made to the palace complex by many of his successors. The complex is divided into a series of courtyards, sprawling gardens and buildings. It is home to several palatial structures like the Chandra Mahal, Mubarak Mahal, Badal Mahal, ShriGovindDev Temple and the City Palace Museum with intricate decorations in deep red and gold, Afghan and Persian carpets, miniature paintings, astronomical manuscripts in Persian and Sanskrit.\u00a0\u00a0The Observatory or Jantar Mantar was begun by Jai Singh in 1728. Jai Singh's passion for astronomy was even more notable than his prowess as a warrior, and before commencing construction he sent scholars abroad to study foreign observatories. The Jaipur observatory is the largest and the best preserved of the five he built; it was restored in 1901. Jantar Mantar may appear to be just a curious collection of sculptures, but in fact each has a specific astronomical purpose, such as measuring the position of stars' altitudes and azimuths, or calculating eclipses.Day 14: This morning we visit the Amber Fort, an old Palace overlooking the lake at the entrance to a rocky mountain grove. Built in the 17th century, the palace is a distinguished specimen of Rajput architecture. The Jai Mandir (Hall of Victory) is so delicately ornamented with fine inlay work that it glows. The fort of Jaigarh, crowning the summit of a peak is of amazing beauty and grandeur.\u00a0After lunch we transfer to the airport and catch our flight back to New Delhi. We prepare for our late night\/early morning departure.Day 15: We will have an early morning transfer to the international airport for our home-bound flights.","leader1":"Rudy Scheffer","leader2":"Kathie Fowler","leader3":""}},{"trip":{"title":"Active Adventure on the Seventh Continent, Antarctica","id":"19500A","dates":"Feb 17, 2019 to Feb 28, 2019","destination":"Antarctica, Argentina","type":"International","group":"","difficulty":"","priceHigh":"8975","priceLow":"8975","image":{"src":"https:\/\/content.sierraclub.org\/outings\/sites\/content.sierraclub.org.outings\/files\/styles\/trip-teaser\/public\/trips\/main-images\/18510_25_KathGiel.jpg?itok=lCDUMpNf","alt":"Active Adventure on the Seventh Continent, Antarctica"},"path":"\/outings\/active-adventure-seventh-continent-antarctica#trip=19500A","overview":"The TripAntarctica is the last continent to remain truly unspoiled by human civilization.

Expect to see spectacular giant buttercup fields on the steep slopes leading up to the central glaciated peaks of the Southern Alps. Returning to the bus, we drive through dense rain-forests and rivers deeply gouged into the earth as we descend to the coast. We make a short stop at Hokitika to check out the traditional greenstone carvings there. Overnight Greymouth.\u00a0Day 5: We start our day with a short drive north to Point Elizabeth for a pleasant walk there. We look for native birds such as the fantail, wood pigeon, and tui. Coordinating our walk with high tide, we will also explore the Punakaiki Rocks (also know as Pancake Rock). The rocks are famous for their horizontal layering and blowholes, limestone formations that have been sculpted through the relentless pounding of the Tasman Sea. Then it\u2019s back south in the bus as we return to Greymouth for the night.Day 6: We take a morning drive to Cape Foulwind for a hike along the coast. Then it's on to Kahurangi National Park and the Graham Valley. Graham Valley has a delightful mix of apple orchards, hop farms, and the occasional vineyard, and provides the most convenient access to Kahurangi National Park. This is the second-largest national park in New Zealand, and its high plateaus and alpine herb fields are seldom visited. The alpine terrain is rugged and beautiful, with tussocks and gnarled beech anchoring the landscape. Our long drive ends with arrival in Nelson. Here we can take the short walk to \u201cThe Center of New Zealand\u201d and it's nice overlook of the city. Overnight Nelson.\u00a0\u00a0Day 7: This morning we head out to Abel Tasman National Park. We relish the sight of its golden-sand beaches that are so different from the west coast. Abel Tasman National Park is famous not only for its golden beaches and sculptured granite cliffs, but also for the world-renowned Abel Tasman Coast Track. We hike a part of this track through stands of ancient rimu, totara and rata, accompanied by the melodious calls of bellbirds. We should have time for a dip in the turquoise waters. A boat will bring us back to the start and we board the bus for our drive to the beautiful Lakes Rotoiti and Rotoroa, nestled amongst the northern peaks of the Southern Alps. Two nights at St. Arnaud.\u00a0Day 8: Today we immerse ourselves in another protected New Zealand parkland! You may opt for a strenuous hike to Mt. Robert, climbing up through the beech forest to the tree line and onto the sub-alpine tussock lands for breathtaking panoramas of the park. On the hike, we can hunt for the hilarious alpine native plant called \u201cvegetable sheep\u201d named for its huge sheep-like shape and white flowers that look like wool. Alternatively there is a lovely ramble along Lake Rotoiti for those wanting to stretch their legs and have a more leisurely day. Dinner again is at our lodge where we can exchange stories.\u00a0Day 9: After breakfast we drive east and then south through following the meandering Wairau River, watching the green New Zealand beech forest, commonly called the New Zealand bush, gradually turn to barren hills. We pass through the Marlborough wine country, stopping for a taste of its famous Sauvignon Blanc along the way and finally arriving at Kaikoura. We should have time for a couple of hours wandering through this small town. Overnight in Kaikoura.Day 10: This morning we experience what makes Kaikoura famous by going on a whale-watching expedition. This is certainly a highlight! At lunch, we compare notes and photos. Then the more energetic could hike up to the mid-slopes of Mt. Fyffe for spectacular views over the Kaikoura coastline while others walk along the peninsula admiring the wildlife. We enjoy a hearty dinner in Kaikoura at one of the many seafood restaurants along the bay. Overnight Kaikoura.Day 11:\u00a0We leave today to cross the Canterbury plains to the Peel Forest Park. We have a short hike in the moist primeval totara forest before continuing over Burkes Pass to the arid inter-montane basins of the Mackenzie Country, named after a notorious Scottish shepherd and sheep thief in the 1850s. This is the place where much of Peter Jackson\u2019s\u00a0The Lord of The Rings\u00a0and\u00a0The Hobbit\u00a0were filmed. In the afternoon we take some time to explore the glacial Lake Ohau and surrounds. Overnight Lake Ohau.Day 12:\u00a0Aoraki\/Moiunt Cook National Park. Aoraki\/Mount Cook shimmers and beckons above the Tasman Glacier. At the foot of Aoraki\/Mount Cook is the spectacular Hooker Valley. The dramatic Mueller Ridge hike awaits today with amazing views all the way along the Southern Alps. We notice the vegetation changes on the successive moraines as we hike below the Hooker and Mueller glaciers. Giant Mount Cook buttercups, golden Spaniards, and sub-alpine shrubs abound amidst unforgettable landscapes. Return to Lake Ohau in the late afternoon to watch the sun set over the Southern Alps. Overnight Lake Ohau.Day 13:\u00a0Our drive today takes us far south to Te Anau, the gateway to the Fiordland World Heritage Area and Fiordland National Park. At times stunning and at other times mysterious, this park is New Zealand\u2019s largest. Glacially gouged valley and lakes are nestled between ranges of rugged mountains. We spend the afternoon enjoying the serenity of the lush beech forests in the Eglinton Valley.\u00a0If you want you can take a boat this evening across lake Te Anau to the glowworm caves (cost not included in the trip price).\u00a0These amazing 12,000-year-old caves were carved out into incredible swirling shapes by the force of the river that flowed through them. We travel through the limestone passages on foot and by boat to find a grotto of thousands of glittering glowworms. Overnight Te Anau.\u00a0Day 14:\u00a0As if it couldn\u2019t get any better, expect to be in awe today! We drive along Milford Road through a landscape of high mountains and deep valleys studded with waterfalls and mirror-like lakes. Passing through the upper Hollyford Valley, with its superb boulder and herb fields, we reach the Gertrude Cirque. This cirque contains the finest accessible alpine community in the country. We spend the morning in this botanical treasure trove in the Darran Mountains. After lunch we descend through the Milford Tunnel to sea level at Milford Sound (which is actually a fjord). Rudyard Kipling rated this fiord as the eighth natural wonder of the world and it is truly breathtaking, with steep granite walls plunging over a thousand meters to the Tasman Sea and waterfalls cascading into deep inky water. There we will take a cruise to the fjord entrance before returning along our road back to Lake Te Anau. Overnight Te Anau.Day 15:\u00a0We start the day with a short visit to the native bird sanctuary in Te Anau, hoping to catch a glimpse of many native birds, especially the extremely endangered takahe. South of Te Anau lies Lake Manapouri, formed (according to Maori legend) by the tears of the two sisters of an old Maori chieftain. We take time to photograph the lake and continue on to the Borland Saddle and the Hunter Mountains. Superb alpine vistas, string tarns and local endemic plants characterize this area. We hike onto the flanks of Mt. Burns to little-visited alpine lakes overlooking the Grebe Valley. Overnight Te Anau.Day 16:\u00a0Alas, we must depart this grand and rugged corner of New Zealand and cross the South Island back to the east side. We travel through central Otago, the \u201cWild West\u201d of New Zealand, now sprinkled with vineyards and eccentric towns. Landing in the wonderful southernmost city of Dunedin, we have a few hours to enjoy its Scottish charm before embarking on a delightful cruise on Otago Harbor to Taiaroa Head. Our trip is timed so we arrive at the harbor entrance just as the Northern Royal Albatross arrive back to their only mainland breeding ground in the world. There can be no better way to complete a New Zealand journey than enjoying the sight of these magnificent fliers circling the headland. We have our farewell dinner back in the city. Overnight Dunedin.Day 17:\u00a0We say goodbye to \u201cThe Land of the Long White Cloud\u201d until we can return!","leader1":"Gene Goldberg","leader2":"","leader3":""}},{"trip":{"title":"Discover the Wild Heart of Patagonia, Chile and Argentina","id":"19555A","dates":"Feb 25, 2019 to Mar 12, 2019","destination":"Latin America, Argentina, Chile","type":"International","group":"","difficulty":"","priceHigh":"6195","priceLow":"6195","image":{"src":"https:\/\/content.sierraclub.org\/outings\/sites\/content.sierraclub.org.outings\/files\/styles\/trip-teaser\/public\/trips\/main-images\/17505_1_EllenStein.jpg?itok=7Fx8LG-B","alt":""},"path":"\/outings\/discover-wild-heart-patagonia-chile-argentina#trip=19555A","overview":"The TripPatagonia is remote, unspoiled, and untamed; nature is at its wildest and you get to see it all on this unique trip!

By day hiking, we'll explore the mountains, glaciers, and lakes of the national parks, nestled in the Andes.Bariloche is the ultimate mountain \"ski town\" here, known for its location and fabulous chocolate. Here we will cross over to Chile by boat and bus, through yet another national park to Puerta Varas. This charming German-style town is on the edge of Lake Llanquihue, which has a massive, snow-capped Osorno Volcano (dormant) towering above it. After three days of hiking, kayaking, and exploring Puerta Varas, we take a plane to Punta Arenas and travel to Torres del Paine National Park to hike sections of the \"W\" -- the classic Patagonian trek. The trail winds along the edge of the mountains next to a chain of glacial lakes and we will take an awe-inspiring day hike to the breathtaking Torres, for which the Park is named. Hiking in Patagonia is \"high altitude\" hiking, but at low altitude -- often above tree line, though barely 3,000 feet above sea level at the most.From here, a bus takes us back over the border to Argentina and El Chalten in Los Glaciares National Park. The famous Mt. Fitzroy massif -- named after the Beagle's Captain Fitzroy, who sailed Charles Darwin's expedition up the Rio Santa Cruz in 1834 -- towers above the town, snow-capped and stunning. The vertical granite fin of the mountain is 11,290 feet high and surrounded by sparkling glaciers. To get there, we will hike through forests of lenga and nirre trees (deciduous \"false\" beeches), then finally over a glacial moraine, to see the magnificent towering peaks and a hidden lake. We may see condors and the endemic Magellanic woodpecker as they nest in these areas.We end the trip with a visit to the awe-inspiring Perito Moreno Glacier, also in the National Park. This groaning, grinding river of ice is vast, a small outlying finger of the Southern Ice Field. It seems endless, dazzlingly white and brilliant blue; one of the few glaciers in the world to be stable.

The hike to the base of the Torres is on a well-maintained trail that gains 1,800 feet over about five miles. The sixth and last mile is a steep trail along the side of a rocky talus slope. It isn't very difficult -- there is no rock scrambling, but it is steep. But the view at the top is worth every step. The Torres are vertical monoliths, part of a high-walled bowl that has a crystalline-blue glacial lake at its center; they are breathtaking from every aspect. 12 miles, 3,000 feet up and 3,000 feet down.\u00a0Stay at Refugio Las Torres.Day 8:\u00a0Today is an easy day. We will transfer through the Park to the boat dock at Pudento and catch the afternoon catamaran across Lago Pehoe to Paine Grande Lodge, our next refugio for three nights. On the way, we can stop to admire stunning waterfalls and see herds of guanacos -- possibly also flamingos and other waterfowl, condors, and foxes.\u00a0This will be our first of three nights in the Refugio Paine Grande Lodge.Day 9:\u00a0The hike today will take us to the French Valley and back. Our walk takes us along Lake Nordenskjold, with outstanding views of the black-tipped mountain peaks of the Cuernos (horns) and the lake. This hike is 10 miles with 1,000 feet gained and lost. There is an optional (and worthwhile) side hike after five miles up French Valley (weather permitting). This adds another five miles and another 1,500 feet onto the day. But you will hike into an enormous granite bowl, surrounded by snow-capped peaks, hanging glaciers, and pygmy forests on the way to the French and British camps, which were the base camps for the climbing expeditions that explored the nearby peaks. 10 miles, 1,000 feet elevation change; up to 15 miles with the French Valley.Day 10:\u00a0We will enjoy a morning\u2019s hike to viewpoints of Lago Grey and Grey Glacier, another finger of the Southern Ice Field, and return to Paine Grande Lodge. All along this hike, you will have outstanding views of the lake, floating icebergs, surrounding mountains, and the glacier. 7 miles, 800 feet and 800 feet down.\u00a0We will take the late afternoon catamaran across the lake to Pudeto, then a short drive to Serrano, where we will stay in yurts.Day 11:\u00a0From Serrano, we will take a private bus to cross the border into Argentina and on to El Chalten. From there we will go to Los Glaciares National Park, where we will stay in a delightful locally owned guest house. El Chalten is a small town, less than 50 years old, that was built as a result of a land swap with Argentina. Although it is still growing, it only has one main street and is quite charming.\u00a0We will spend four nights in a charming, locally owned guesthouse.Day 12:\u00a0We will take a lovely, picturesque hike from the hotel to Laguna Torres, which is under another set of \"torres,\" part of the Fitzroy massif. The trail runs along the ridge of a canyon and then over the moraine to the lake, where you will see icebergs -- not recommended for swimming! 12 miles, 600 feet up and 600 feet down.\u00a0Dinner is on your own tonight.Day 13:\u00a0Today we will enjoy another incredible hike to see Mt. Fitzroy, the \"jewel in the crown\" of the massif! We take a shuttle bus to the trailhead, hike up to the base of the mountain to the glacial lake and then continue to another, hidden lake. It is a day of strenuous walking as we'll be hiking for 15 miles (round-trip) to Laguna Torre, which has breathtaking views of Mt. Fitzroy and Glac-ier Grande. On our hike on the well-marked trail, we'll pass through several ecosystems, maybe see the Magellanic woodpecker, which is endemic to Southern Patagonia, and be treated to in-credible views of the mountain range. The trail up to the base of Mt. Fitzroy is steep for the last mile, but the lake and massif view at the top makes it all worthwhile. From there, we walk back to town and our hotel by a different trail, past freshwater pools and minature trees, through lenga forests and verdant meadows, directly onto the main street, where we can buy an ice cream that's flavored with local fruits as our reward! 15 miles, 1,800 feet up and 2,600 feet down.Day 14:\u00a0Our last hiking day! Weather permitting, we will hike along the Rio Electric through a stunning green valley, enjoying incredible vistas of Mt Fitzroy and the other mountains in the range, to a remote refugio for tea and cookies! 12 miles round trip, 500 feet up and 500 feet down.Day 15: Our final full day! A private bus and guide will take us from El Chalten this morning to visit the magnificent Perito Moreno Glacier. We can watch it calving and creaking as the ice formations react to the environmental changes of snow, air, and water. After lunch (on your own), we get back on the bus and drive back to El Calafate and our hotel. We will have a wonderful farewell dinner in a local restaurant.Day 16: We depart after breakfast for flights back to Buenos Aires and the U.S.","leader1":"Angela White","leader2":"","leader3":""}},{"trip":{"title":"Raft, Kayak, Wildlife, and Waterfalls: An Active Costa Rica Adventure","id":"19560A","dates":"Mar 2, 2019 to Mar 10, 2019","destination":"Latin America, Costa Rica","type":"International","group":"","difficulty":"","priceHigh":"3395","priceLow":"3025","image":{"src":"https:\/\/content.sierraclub.org\/outings\/sites\/content.sierraclub.org.outings\/files\/styles\/trip-teaser\/public\/trips\/main-images\/19560_3_PatrickTierney.jpg?itok=Tb-EQCB5","alt":"Raft, Kayak, Wildlife, and Waterfalls: An Active Costa Rica Adventure"},"path":"\/outings\/raft-kayak-wildlife-waterfalls-active-costa-rica-adventure#trip=19560A","overview":"The TripRenowned for its diverse natural beauty and protected areas, Costa Rica provides a fantastic setting for an active water-themed nature adventure.

We'll have two days to visit Swayambunath, the Monkey Temple; Bodnath, one of the world's largest stupas or Buddhist shrines; and Pashupatinath, the holiest Hindu temple in Nepal. Guided exploration of Patan and Bhaktapur, the two other ancient cities of the Kathmandu Valley, show off a time when Nepal was the most advanced in architecture and wood carving.The rest of Nepal enjoys a quiet, rural existence that we'll appreciate as we start our trek in the foothill village of Syabrubesi. Climbing through protected forests of oak, chir pine, rhododendron, and alder, we'll be in the playground of langur monkeys. Barking deer, wild boars, red pandas, and Himalayan black bears also inhabit these forests. Ascending quickly to the upper Langtang Valley brings us to the terminus of three glaciers that form the valley's head below 23,767-foot Lantang Lirung and 22,848-foot Dorje Lakpa. We diverge our return to visit holy Gosainkund Lakes, where thousands of Hindu pilgrims come in August to bathe in their pure waters. A string of glacial lakes range from 14,000 feet to near the top of our high pass at 15,120-foot Laurebina La. The steep, rocky descent on the other side takes us through more densely blooming rhododendron forests and terraced farms and villages as we finish in the Kathmandu Valley.While most people come to Nepal to trek on the roof of the world, they are surprised to learn that the cultures of its many ethnic groups are at least as interesting. Nepal's true treasure is the warmth and hospitality of its people, and this trek offers the opportunity to bond with our staff and experience their homeland more as a local than a tourist. The sirdar, or head guide and trek organizer, is the leader's husband of over 20 years, so with their staff of extended family and villagers, the expedition feels more like one large traveling family. Indeed this is the trip of a lifetime, but the joy and friendliness of the Nepalese people will beckon you to return again and again!","highlights":"Trek ancient pilgrimage route below 23,000-foot peaks, See entire hillsides covered with rhododendron blooms, Visit ancient temples and monasteries in Kathmandu","includes":"  Guides, cooks, porters, and all equipment for the trek,   Airport transfers and trek transportation,   All meals and Kathmandu hotel","itinerary":"Travel in Nepal is still truly adventurous. Although we will try to adhere to a daily itinerary, please embrace any changes that may have to be made due to weather, trail conditions, ability of the group, or the serendipity of the unexpected. This is what makes adventure travel fun and enhances your experience.Day 1:\u00a0(Arrive Kathmandu) Transfer to our hotel. We'll have an orientation about the trip, then the afternoon is free to explore the neighborhood of Thamel. Enjoy a welcome dinner of traditional Nepali fare.Day 2:\u00a0(Kathmandu) To recover from jet lag, we'll take a dawn warm-up walk up 300 feet of stairs to see Hindu and Buddhist temples and to hear beautiful Newari singing at Swayambunath, the Monkey Temple. The rest of the day is spent first in the Hindu world of Pashupatinath where we'll see sadhus, temples dedicated to Shiva and a host of other gods, and ritual funeral burnings on ghats along the Bagmati River. Then we enter the Buddhist world at Bodnath, one of the largest stupas in the world. A welcoming home for Tibetan refugees, monasteries and shops selling Tibetan and Buddhist goods circle the stupa as monks chant while doing their kora, or circumambulation of the shrine. Dinner at a fine Indian restaurant.Day 3:\u00a0(Kathmandu-Syabrubesi) We board our chartered bus with our staff and gear for an exhilarating ride through the bucolic countryside to begin our trek. The last half of the drive is on tightly winding dirt road that shows the difficulty of keeping roads maintained on steep, unstable hillsides. We reach Syabrubesi by mid-afternoon where the bus is unloaded and camp is set up above the upper Trisuli River, just below its confuence with the Langtang Khola (river). This is our first night in tents (4,820 feet).Day 4:\u00a0(Syabrubesi-Lama Hotel) We begin the day by crossing the Trisuli River on our first suspension bridge of many, then crossing the Langtang Khola as we head up the river valley. We'll keep an eye out for monkeys cavorting in the dense jungle ablaze with rhododendron blooms. In this lightly settled canyon we're likely to see flashy magpies and hear other birds singing. A steep climb of 3,300 feet past an abundance of waterfalls brings us to camp at Lama Hotel (8,135 feet) in seven hours.Day 5:\u00a0(Lama Hotel-Langtang) There's more steep climbing up the narrow canyon until at last the valley begins to open up and take on the characteristics of a classic U-shaped glacial valley. The gradient mellows upon reaching the previous village site of Langtang (11,250), which was swept away in a landslide of rock and ice during the 2015 earthquake. A memorial in the large debris field is all that's left of this once vibrant town that housed the Langtang National Park headquarters. The new village is being built on a safe plateau above this site where we'll camp for the night. We'll begin to see yaks here and possibly a Himalayan lynx. Ascend 3,100 feet in six hours.Day 6:\u00a0(Langtang-Kyanjin Gompa) The valley continues to open up, leaving forests behind as more high peaks become visible on the three-hour, 1,400-foot climb to Kyanjin Gompa (monastery) at 12,660 feet. This is the last permanent settlement in the valley and with the colder temperatures at this elevation, we may find ourselves eating in dining rooms heated with yak dung. We'll spend the afternoon acclimatizing with walks to the yak cheese factory, the monastery, and up on the ridges above camp for spectacular views of the icefalls tumbling down the Langtang Himal. This is camp for two nights.Day 7:\u00a0(Kyanjin Gompa) Waking to the sunlit peaks of Langtang Lirung, Dorje Lakpa (22,848 feet), and Gangchenpo (20,920 feet), we'll dayhike up the undulating path on our layover day to the head of the valley at Langshisa Kharka (meadow) at 13,450 feet, the terminus of three glaciers. The snowbound hulk of massive Pemthang Karpo Ri, 22,517 feet, dominates the skyline. We may see lammergeiers and other raptors soaring along with blooming violet-blue alpine gentians on this round-trip hike of 7-8 hours.Days 8-9:\u00a0(Kyanjin Gompa-Lama Hotel-Thulo Syabru) Returning the way we came, we'll descend in eight hours to Lama Hotel, where monkeys may distract us to watch their antics along the way. We continue down to 5,700 feet where we'll begin the long, steep climb to camp at Thulo Syabru (7,400 feet) in six hours. This village is majestically perched on a knife-edge ridge with our terraced campsite affording mountain views up the Langtang Valley. We are now on one of the pilgrimage routes to Gosainkund Lake and have split off from most of the other trekkers.Day 10:\u00a0(Thulo Syabru-Sing Gompa) A steady, steep uphill climb through oak, hemlock, and moss-draped rhododendron forests leads to a ridgetop view of the Langtang and Ganesh Himals. Monkeys play in these forests along the final, pleasant stretch of the 3,500-foot climb to Sing Gompa (10,920 feet) in five hours. Barking deer may call to us at this scenic campsite.Day 11:\u00a0(Sing Gompa-Laurebina Yak) We continue another 2,000 feet up ridges and through deep forests that are home to the endangered red panda. We enter the Gosainkund protected area, where wood fires, the killing of animals, and grazing goats are prohibited. We'll reach camp at Laurebina Yak (12,860 feet) in 3-4 hours, with time in the afternoon to spend gawking at the Himalayan panorama from the Annapurnas, Manaslu, and Ganesh Himals to unnamed peaks in Tibet and finally to Langtang Lirung. Lammergeiers may be seen circling on the high thermals, and those venturing out after dark will be rewarded with brilliant stars sparkling through jet-black skies.Day 12:\u00a0(Laurebina Yak-Gosainkund Lake) The first 900 feet of this climb are very steep up to two stupas (Buddhist shrines) with a commanding view of the Himalaya. The remaining 700 feet of the climb has more gentle ups and downs, with arrival at Gosainkund (14,400 feet) in three hours. Our camp includes a Hindu temple where a sadhu may be meditating at the holy waters of the lake. We can hike a kora (circumambulation) around the lake in the afternoon and explore other small lakes in the chain. Those with energy can hike up the ridge behind camp for phenomenal views.Day 13:\u00a0(Gosainkund Lake-Laurebina La-Phedi) This is our high-pass day going over 15,120-foot Laurebina La (pass). Starting around the lake, we pass three waterspouts with animal heads that have been built at one of the cascade inlets to the lake. Then it's a steady climb past Ganesh, Barda, and Surya Kunds (lakes) along the way. After passing the large chorten (shrine) at the pass, the descent quickly gets steep, with loose rock and icy patches. A slow, careful descent brings us to an austere, scenic camp at Phedi (12,265 feet) in 4-5 hours.Day 14:\u00a0(Phedi-Tharepati) We continue going down the steep, rocky trail with a surprising number of ridges to climb as well. Descending below Gopte, we begin a 1,100-foot climb up to Tharepati (11,940 feet), looking back at what seems like an impossible route, arriving in 6-7 hours. Perched on a high ridge, the panorama extends clear to the Khumbu, where peaks near Mt. Everest can be seen.Days 15-17:\u00a0(Tharepati-Chisopani) The next three days are spent ascending and descending -- mostly descending -- many ridges as we head down toward the Kathmandu Valley. We're greeted by the spectacle of the rhododendron bloom again as we re-enter the forests, and our ridgetop campsites open up wider, more expansive vistas from the Annapurnas to Everest. At Chisopani (7,000 feet), situated on the rim of the Kathmandu Valley and our last camp in tents, we'll celebrate our success with our hardworking staff and porters, honoring them with a party. Over these three days, we descend 4,900 feet.Day 18:\u00a0(Chisopani-Kathmandu) For our last hiking day we have one more ridge to climb before the long downhill to Sundarijal (4,430 feet) on the outskirts of Kathmandu. We pass beautiful waterfalls, rhesus monkeys, and lovely village gardens on the 3,500-foot descent in four hours. Re-entry to chaotic Kathmandu is bitterweet as it's just a short drive back to our hotel with plenty of time for hot showers and shopping before dinner.Day 19:\u00a0(Kathmandu) After breakfast we'll have a guided tour of the ancient cities of Patan and Bhaktapur, each with its own kings, temples, and Durbar Squares to show off offerings to its gods. Patan's museum is well worth visiting, and the peace and quiet in old Bhaktapur is like going back in time. We'll honor our trekking staff again at our farewell dinner at a favorite Thamel restaurant.Day 20:\u00a0(Depart Kathmandu) We'll decompress over breakfast at a restaurant serving American favorites before transferring to the airport for our flights home.","leader1":"Melinda Goodwater","leader2":"","leader3":""}},{"trip":{"title":"Exploring North Holland by Bike and Barge","id":"19580A","dates":"Apr 10, 2019 to Apr 20, 2019","destination":"Europe, Netherlands","type":"International","group":"","difficulty":"","priceHigh":"4245","priceLow":"4245","image":{"src":"https:\/\/content.sierraclub.org\/outings\/sites\/content.sierraclub.org.outings\/files\/styles\/trip-teaser\/public\/trips\/main-images\/17570_1_JohnBlaustein_3.jpg?itok=zoOgLF8b","alt":""},"path":"\/outings\/exploring-holland-bike-barge#trip=19580A","overview":"The TripWe will spend three nights in Amsterdam, highlighted by exposure to some of its world-renowned museums.

Here, wildlife is easily approachable due to its isolation from many predators, including humans. The Gal\u00e1pagos Islands are among the world\u2019s foremost wildlife preserves, providing us with unique and amazing experiences. In fact, a full 50 percent of the species here are not found anywhere else in the world. Such creatures include the three-foot-long vegetarian marine iguana, which is the only known sea-feeding lizard on earth, and the Gal\u00e1pagos tortoise, which can grow to six feet in length, weigh 600 pounds, and live for 150 years. And of course, Darwin\u2019s finches, the icon of evolution--EXPANDFROMHERE--.\u00a0Darwin was the archipelago's most famous visitor; his chapter on the Gal\u00e1pagos in The Voyage of the Beagle remains a classic and is well worth reading. He made extensive collections of plants and animals and observations of their natural history, giving him sufficient material to support more than a quarter-century of research. Twenty-four years later, he published the classic The Origin of Species, which shook the foundations of biological thought and led to profound changes in the philosophy of nature. These are the very islands that inspired Charles Darwin in 1835, and on this trip we will visit the Charles Darwin Research Center.\u00a0We will explore both inhabited and uninhabited islands in the Gal\u00e1pagos. On land, we will observe severe volcanic landscapes with fascinating geologic features, walk through lava fields, hike the highland searching for the giant Gal\u00e1pagos tortoise, walk through colonies of blue-footed boobies and frigate birds, identify Darwin\u2019s finches, step around mounds of marine iguanas, and take in the culture of island villages. Our days will be filled with activity, but you'll also have the freedom to just relax.\u00a0Much of the unique life of the Gal\u00e1pagos is below water, so we will snorkel protected areas for a close look at the marine life. We hope to observe some of the Gal\u00e1pagos penguins swimming with us, as well as sea lions, sea turtles, sharks, rays, various fish varieties, seahorses and a multitude of other fascinating life found in these nutrient-rich waters.An English-speaking certified Gal\u00e1pagos naturalist will accompany us and help us understand the amazing relationships between plants, animals, people, and their environment.The play of light and water over the geologic landscape and the close encounters with wildlife make Gal\u00e1pagos a photographer\u2019s dream.\u00a0Our trip starts and ends in Guayaquil, the commercial hub of Ecuador and its major seaport. Here we will visit a chocolate farm and taste the exquisite chocolates Ecuador has become famous for, and have a tour of the city.","highlights":"Explore a premier world wildlife destination, Stay in comfortable island lodges with daily outings, Tour an Ecuadorian chocolate farm and coffee plantation","includes":"  All meals, lodging, and on-trip transportation,   All admission fees and gratuities,   Gal\u00e1pagos-certified naturalist guide while in Gal\u00e1pagos","itinerary":"Day 1: Arrive in Guayaquil, Ecuador\u2019s major seaport, where you will be met at the airport by a driver and transferred to our hotel.

The flight to and from the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands (1 \u00bd hours) is included in the trip price. Tickets will be issued to you at the Guayaquil airport before we leave for the islands. \u00a0We arrive at the Seymore airport on Baltra and are met by our certified Gal\u00e1pagos naturalist guide. \u00a0We will take two short bus rides and a ferry ride to the Highlands, a virtual cloud forest, to look for giant tortoises in the wild. The landscape changes sharply along the way, as we go from the coast to lush, mist-shrouded highlands. After enjoying lunch here we take a short walk through a rain forest environment, where we might catch a glimpse of the spectacular vermillion flycatcher! Afterward we check into our hotel and enjoy dinner at a local restaurant in the coastal town and popular tourist center, Puerto Ayora.\u00a0Day 4: A full day of discovery awaits us as we cruise to North Seymore and Playa Las Bachas Beach on a yacht dedicated to us. Here, a magical tour of enigmatic Gal\u00e1pagos wildlife awaits with blue-footed boobies, frigate birds, lava herons, lava gulls, and marine iguanas -- all up close and unafraid of us. Playa Las Bachas is one of the main nesting sites for sea turtles on Santa Cruz. The short walk around the lagoon lets us also study the island\u2019s unique botany. It is a bevy of activity. \u00a0This excursion includes a stop and stroll at Las Bachas Beach where one might see pink flamingos in the lagoons and sea turtles just off the beach. Here we will have the opportunity to snorkel in the clear waters. \u00a0Day 5: The Charles Darwin Research Station is our first visit today. This was where the famous Lonesome George resided after being found. He was the last remaining giant tortoise from the Island of Pinta. \u00a0Unfortunately, Lonesome George passed away in May 2012; however, there is a memorial facility to him, which opened in 2017. Our Gal\u00e1pagos guide will explain the turtle breeding program while we try to sort out the different species of giant tortoise at the facility. The Center is home to the scientific programs on the islands and is also the main educational center for visitors. A wealth of information is available through their online portal (darwinfoundation.org\/datazone). After lunch, we will walk to Tortuga Bay, which is only accessible by foot. We can relax and enjoy one of the most stunning expanses of white beach in the Gal\u00e1pagos -- home to hundreds of prehistoric-looking marine iguanas, blue-footed boobies, and pelicans. We can relax, swim, or snorkel.Day 6: On to Isabella Island! This morning our speedboat will take us to our next island in time for lunch in Puerto Villamil, where we will check into our beachfront hotel. In the afternoon, a walk through mangroves along a wooden pathway reveals an intertidal pond, both frequented by sea lions and enjoyed by locals for swimming and snorkeling. Penguins have been also been reported here. We will visit the Arnaldo Tupiza Centro de Crianza de Tortugas Turtle Center and appreciate the value of these breeding centers in light of the invasive pests that plague the Tortugas in reproducing in the wild. \u00a0Day 7: Today we get aerobic with a hike up the volcano to Sierra Negra and Volcano Chico. Along the way, we enjoy the changing habitats and birdlife, but geology is the focus of the day as we attempt the rim of the second-largest volcanic caldera in the world. A box lunch will maximize our time in the area.\u00a0Day 8: We\u2019ll be back in the marine and coastal environment for this day\u2019s excursion to Cabo Rosa (Los Tuneles), with lunch in the field. This unique spot is a marine paradise and one of the most famous snorkeling spots in the Gal\u00e1pagos. Lava flows into the ocean have formed tunnels in the water, for which this site is named. Flightless cormorants, only found in the Gal\u00e1pagos, may be seen here, along with penguins, sea turtles, and sea lions.\u00a0Day 9: Off to our last island, San Cristobal, this time by plane. This is the oldest island geologically and the first island of Darwin\u2019s visit. Its main town is Puerto Baquerizo Moreno, the capital of the Gal\u00e1pagos province, which fronts the water, intriguingly named Shipwreck Bay. \u00a0We will be able to visit the Hacienda El Cafetal coffee plantation, producer of Gal\u00e1pagos Coffee, a UNESCO Patrimony of Humanity site (a sustainable resource for island peoples). The plantation has been growing organic, bird-friendly, and sustainable shade-grown coffee from heirloom plants since 1875. We will tour the plantation and local surroundings.Day 10: Our last full day in Gal\u00e1pagos will take us to Kicker Rock by boat for a full day of exploring remarkable shorelines, snorkeling, and possibly sighting a Gal\u00e1pagos specialty, the scalloped hammerhead. We will have lunch on a nearby beach to swim, bird the booby and frigatebird rookeries, snorkel, take photos, or just take in the magic that has made these islands famous. With luck we could encounter the friendly sea lion pups, who just might choose to swim with us! As time allows, we may visit the Interpretative Center and explore the Center\u2019s trails, and have time to relax, explore the town, or take a dip at the beach across from our hotel.Day 11: Today we fly back to Guayaquil and return to our welcoming hotel for our last night together and a Sierra Club happy hour, sharing favorite experiences and highlights of the trip.Day 12: Unfortunately, this wonderful trip ends today after breakfast. We must say good bye to our Gal\u00e1pagos\u00a0adventure and our new-found friends, and depart with wonderful experiences, photos, and a greater appreciation for nature and conservation. Airport transfers are included.Please note that this itinerary may change due to factors outside of human control, for safety reasons, or upon the advice of our guides, who are working to optimize your experience while on the Islands.

We will walk through three of England's national parks: the Lake District, renowned for its gorgeous lakes and craggy peaks; the Yorkshire Dales, with its gentle green valleys full of ancient stone walls and old farms, and popularized by the PBS series,\u00a0All Creatures Great and Small; and the North York Moors, which is secluded and lush with heather, and ends at a picturesque coastline along the North Sea. Along the way we will stop in remote and quiet old country villages and hamlets to refresh ourselves in pubs and tea rooms and we\u2019ll also take time to wander through medieval ruins and monuments giving evidence of England\u2019s ancient history.Our adventure begins with a visit to Carlisle Castle, which has been standing guard for over 900 years. Our luggage will be shuttled by van daily to the next B&B, leaving us free and unburdened to enjoy our day with just a day pack. Our walks vary in length from 7\u201313 miles each day and on occasion, our van will transport us across sections of this classic walk.We will be accompanied by some local ramblers on several walks and they will also join us for dinner, giving us insights into the rhythm of life in rural England. This part of England had a vibrant history in mining -\u2013 we\u2019ll cross landscapes showing evidence of lead, coal, and iron mining reaching back into the early 18th century.The following is a tentative description of our day-to-day activities, giving a flavor of what you can expect on this trip. Inclement weather or poor trail conditions could require changes to the itinerary.","highlights":"Walk through some of England\u2019s most scenic countryside, Tour ancient monuments and ruins, Enjoy charming English villages and their local pubs","includes":"  All accommodations,   All meals, entrance fees, and gratuities,   Luggage transfers each day","itinerary":"Day 1: Carlisle to St. Bees. Our trip officially begins after breakfast, when we meet to review the day\u2019s activities, address any last-minute questions, and then take off on a walking history tour of the castle and the town of Carlisle. After lunch, our van will take us to St. Bees and our accommodations. This is about a one-hour drive away. After checking in, we have a tour of St. Bees Priory--EXPANDFROMHERE--. This site originated in the 7th century as a nunnery established by St. Bega and later became a Benedictine Priory in the 12th century. We regroup again afterward for dinner.Day 2: St. Bees to Cleator. (9.4 miles, elevation change +1,100 feet, -1,000 feet) After the traditional dipping of our boots into the Irish Sea, we will begin the ascent and traverse of St. Bees Head, a three-mile-long promontory that ends in cliffs that fall 300 feet to the Irish Sea. On a clear day, you can see the Lakeland fells (hills) to the east and the Isle of Man to the west. Following lunch at a small village, we wind our way through a network of fields and lanes to Cleator. At the end of today\u2019s walk, we take some time for well-deserved refreshments at a local pub before being transported to our B&Bs to freshen up for dinner.Day 3: Ennerdale Bridge to Honister. (11.5 miles, +1,400 feet, -600 feet) We begin by walking along the shore of Ennerdale Water, the westernmost lake in the Lake District, to Ennerdale Forest. After a lunch break at Black Sail Youth Hostel, formerly a shepherd\u2019s hut, we have a strenuous 1,000-foot climb over Honister Pass, overshadowed by the magnificent mountain scenery of Pillar (2,927 feet) and Great Gable (2,949 feet) and the rugged Haystacks, where Wainwright\u2019s ashes are scattered. The path leads down to Honister Quarry, where we will visit one of the oldest slate mines still operating. From there, we will board our waiting bus to our B&B accommodations at Borrowdale, a very picturesque Lakeland valley.Day 4: Stonethwaite to Grasmere. (8.5 miles, +1,950 feet, -2,050 feet) Our second day in the Lake District starts by walking into the secluded side valley of Stonethwaite, dominated by Eagle Crag. Next is Greenup Edge, the pass separating Borrowdale and Grasmere in the Far Easedale valley. Pending fine weather after lunch, we may elect to continue up to the summit rocks of Helm Crag, better known as \u201cThe Lion and The Lamb,\u201d an amazing array of pinnacles and tilted rock slabs. Following our ascent, we\u2019ll descend into the historic village of Grasmere, the birthplace of William Wordsworth. We will overnight in Grasmere.Day 5: Grasmere to Patterdale. (8.5 miles, +1,900 feet, -1,600 feet) Today we have a gradual climb up to Grisedale Pass, where we\u2019ll stop to enjoy the view of Grisedale Tarn (lake) below, backed by Dollywagon Pike. Beyond the pass we descend to walk alongside the lake between Helvellyn Peak (3,118 feet) and St. Sunday Crag, and continue onwards to Glenridding, where we will spend the next two nights.Day 6: Howtown to Glenridding. (6.5 miles, +1,000 feet, -1,000 feet) Today we will deviate from Wainwright's classic route to see the gorgeous Ullswater Lake, the second largest lake in the Lake District and shaped like a dog\u2019s leg. We take a boat ride on one of the historic passenger vessels from lakeside Glenridding to Howtown. Afterward our return hike follows the lakeshore back to our accommodation in Glenridding.Day 7: Sunbiggin Tarn to Kirkby Stephen. (6.4 miles, +600 feet, -1,000 feet) The day starts with a bus ride to shorten what would otherwise be a 22-mile walk. The hills in this area are gentler and our route less rocky than in the Lake District. After crossing near Rayseat Pike and the lower slopes of Crosby Garret Fell, we will see the site of the prehistoric village of Severals in the valley of Smardale, and the lime kilns on Smardale Fell. We'll continue walking to the old market town of Kirkby Stephen, where we will stay the night.Day 8: Kirkby Stephen to Keld. (12 miles, +1,900 feet, -1,450 feet) We will begin the 1,570-foot climb to Nine Standards Rigg, large cairns dating back to at least pre-18th century. Two important milestones are reached in this section of the walk; we enter Yorkshire Dales National Park, and we cross the watershed of the Pennines at the highest point of the fell -- 2,178 feet. We will descend to Keld for the night.Day 9: Keld to Gunnerside. (8.5 miles, +500 feet, -800 feet) We will follow the course of the River Swale along the valley floor. From Keld we will cross the river by a footbridge near East Gill Force (waterfall) and climb to the ruins of Crackpot Hall (a former lead mining area), then down to the path along the river. There are many old mines in this area, dating back to the 17th and 18th centuries, together with evidence of lead extraction from the Roman time period. Then we walk on to Gunnerside where we meet our bus and ride on to Richmond for a well-deserved rest day.Day 10: Rest day in Richmond, North Yorkshire. Richmond is a large, historic town founded by the Normans in 1071 \u2013- the castle and its keep still dominate the surroundings. The Georgian period, in the late 17th and 18th centuries, marked Richmond\u2019s heyday, with much elegant architecture being erected around its cobbled marketplace, reported to be one of the largest in England. A walking tour is planned in the morning for those who wish to join. The rest of the day is free to explore the many attractions, parks, gardens, or Richmond Castle, or to just wander along the River Swale to Easeby Abbey.Day 11: Swainby to Clay Bank Top. (8.5 miles, +2,200 feet, -1,600 feet) Before our hike begins, our bus will take us for a tour at Mount Grace Priory, a ruined Carthusian monastery dating from 1398. We are now in the North York Moors National Park. Wainwright described the moors as \"unenclosed, uninhabited, remote from industry and noise and free from traffic -- a magnificent territory for the walker.\" We will pass the well-known landmark of the Wainstones on Hasty Bank, and then descend to Clay Bank Top, where we will be met by bus and taken to nearby Great Broughton for a night's stay.Day 12: Clay Bank Top to Lion Inn at Blakey. (9.0 miles, +1,000 feet, -500 feet) As we leave Clay Bank Top, the ground will rise steadily across Urra Moor, the highest point of the North York Moors. There are beautiful views of Bransdale, Farndale (famous for its daffodils in spring), and Rosedale. We will enjoy refreshments in Blakey at the venerable Lion Inn, which dates back to 1553. Our bus will then take us to the North Sea town of Whitby where we will stay our last two nights.Day 13: Whitby to Robin Hood's Bay. (6.5 miles, +1,000 feet, -1,000 feet) Leaving Whitby, we\u2019ll pass the dramatic Whitby Abbey, which inspired Bram Stoker to write Dracula. From there we'll continue along the coast on the Cleveland Way a few miles until we rejoin the Coast-to-Coast track. Today\u2019s walk will take us along the cliff tops overlooking the North Sea and drop us into the picturesque smugglers village of Robin Hood\u2019s Bay, where we will ceremoniously and triumphantly dip our feet in the North Sea, enjoy a walk through the charming and historic village, and have lunch at a seaside pub. After lunch we will visit Whitby Abbey, founded in 657, and the town of Whitby. Following today\u2019s activities, we will gather for our farewell dinner.Day 14: Whitby to York. Our bus will depart at 9 a.m. for York, a journey of about two hours. We will say goodbye here, after accomplishing a remarkable feat. The trip ends at the York Train Station at approximately 11 a.m.","leader1":"Steve Welter","leader2":"","leader3":""}},{"trip":{"title":"Hiking Japan's Ancient Buddhist Trails, Rainforests, and Volcanos, Kyushu","id":"19625A","dates":"May 13, 2019 to May 25, 2019","destination":"Asia & the Pacific, Japan","type":"International","group":"","difficulty":"","priceHigh":"6695","priceLow":"6695","image":{"src":"https:\/\/content.sierraclub.org\/outings\/sites\/content.sierraclub.org.outings\/files\/styles\/trip-teaser\/public\/trips\/main-images\/19625_1_EllenStein.jpg?itok=kIkLdS0i","alt":"Hiking Japan's Ancient Buddhist Trails, Rainforests, and Volcanoes, Kyushu"},"path":"\/outings\/hiking-japan-ancient-buddhist-trails-rainforests-volcanoes-kyushu#trip=19625A","overview":"The TripJoin us for an unforgettable trek through widely varied terrain, in a much less-traveled part of Japan. Our hikes will take us through verdant forests, alongside volcanic mountains, and into breathtaking valleys. We begin our journey by hiking ancient forested Buddhist pilgrim paths on the Kunisaki Peninsula in Kyushu, Japan's southernmost large island. Mine-iri, a monk\u2019s practice of traversing sacred mountain paths in prayer, has been part of the religious life of Kunisaki since the ninth-century. Even today, monks occasionally make use of these trails. At times we'll put on our gloves, so we can use placed chains as climbing aids up steep volcanic ridges, before invariably heading down again into lush green valleys. The trails lead us to temples and shrines along the way.We'll also encounter some of Kyushu's volcanoes. Just south of Kunisaki Peninsula, near the resort town of Yufuin, we will ascend Mount Yufu. Farther south, at Aso-Kuju National Park, we will hike very near Mount Aso, where we hope to get a glimpse of this active volcano. While these fantastic volcanic formations are breathtaking in their own right, they provide stunning views of the surrounding forests, too.On other parts of our journey we'll take ferry rides to adjoining islands. First, we'll enjoy a brief overnight visit to the small island of Hime-shima. We'll stay in a family-owned ryokan (small inn), where we'll enjoy fresh seafood and a sunset over the beach. The next morning, we'll hike up to a small shoreline vista with spectacular views.\u00a0We also visit a much larger island, taking a two-hour journey south of Kyushu on a high-speed jet foil. Thickly forested Yakushima Island juts abruptly out of the ocean to a height of more than 6,000 feet. We'll stay two nights there, time enough to explore the island's historic old cedar forests, high moorlands, and grasslands. The entirety of the island is a designated World Heritage site.Each day we will end our walks by soaking in thermal hot springs (\"onsen\") or heated tubs. Most nights are spent in small family-owned Japanese ryokans, where we have our evening meals prepared fresh on site. Don\u2019t worry about bringing a lot of extra clothing for evening wear. Yukata, or Japanese robes, and the ubiquitous slippers are provided at almost all of our stays.\u00a0We also plan to visit a samurai village and a few other cultural sites. Time permitting, we will visit a brewing company, where we will learn the fine art of brewing sake and, if you wish, sample some of the final product. You will learn a lot about Japan's geography, customs and history during this trip. Come prepared for vigorous hiking and a good introduction to Japanese culture!","highlights":"Hike to ancient Buddhist temples and shrines, Enjoy relaxing nightly soaks at spring-fed hot tubs, Visit the vertiginous forests of Yakushima Island","includes":"  All lodging, in-country transportation, and admissions,   Japanese\/English-speaking guide,   Most meals and all gratuities","itinerary":"Day 1:\u00a0Fukuoka. We will meet at a hotel in Fukuoka near the Hakata Train Station. From there we will walk to the station and take a train for an hour and 40 minutes to Oita City, located on the Kunisaki Peninsula. We will then visit Usa Jingu, an ancient and impressive Shinto shrine. This shrine was instrumental in the development of the distinct Buddhism of the Kunisaki Peninsula. Dinner at tonight\u2019s lodging is a Japanese feast of locally caught fish and home-grown farm produce. Dinner provided.Day 2:\u00a0Futago-ji - Matama Onsen. After breakfast at our accommodation, a minibus will take us on a 25-minute journey to our start point at the heart of the Kunisaki Peninsula. Luggage, aside from daypacks, is forwarded on to our evening's lodgings for us. Very soon after the start of the trek, we find ourselves in a verdant forest and remote countryside. We visit some secluded temples and have lunch in a small, local restaurant. The afternoon's trek includes a short but stiff climb, using a chain assist in one area, up to a view of Mumyo-bashi: a bridge perched spectacularly between two crags. The final descent brings us down to road level and our last temple for the day. From here it is a 45-minute walk to a well-deserved thermal hot spring and our lodgings for the night. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner provided. Total walking time: six hours. Total distance: approximately 7.4 miles.Day 3:\u00a0Matama Onsen - Hime-shima. Our luggage is sent on by taxi, while we travel a short distance by minibus to the beginning of Nakayama Senkyo, a lower elevation ridge climb. Near the top on narrow ridges we will see some spectacular views over the surrounding countryside and the Seto Inland Sea.\u00a0We'll have a delicious bento box lunch. After lunch we wind our way up over a pass using a chain to assist us in a steep area before descending to an idyllic hamlet. We then meet our transport, which takes us to nearby Imi Port. Hime-shima, a small island, is 20 minutes away by ferry. From there we have a short walk from the quay to our inn for the night. The island is a delightful place, with the main settlement a maze of narrow streets, houses, and little vegetable plots. Our dinner is focused on locally caught fresh fish from some of the best fishing grounds within the Seto Inland Sea. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner provided. Total walking time: five hours. Total distance: approximately. 4.9 miles.Day 4:\u00a0Hime-shima \u2013 Monjusen-ji. We return by ferry to Imi Port after a short but beautiful visit to a local temple. After sending our luggage on, we have lunch at a local restaurant before catching a bus\/taxi to the start of today's trek. We soon pass through the atmospheric grounds of a long-gone temple. Little is left of this once powerful institution except stone Buddha statues and hundreds of monks' gravestones. The latter includes Ninmon's last resting place. Ninmon was the monk that is reputed to have first brought Buddhism to Kunisaki some 1,100 years ago. A climb to Itsutsu-ji Fudo provides impressive views across the Seto Inland Sea to Honshu and Shikoku, respectively Japan's first and fourth main islands. From here we also have grandstand views over to Hime-shima. Next, we walk down through forests to Monjusen-ji, a temple perched on a high cliff. Breakfast and dinner provided. Total walking time: four hours. Total distance: approx. 4.9 miles.Day 5:\u00a0Monjusen-ji - Futago-ji - Baien-no-Sato. Today, we pass through virgin forests and cedar plantations before we descend to an old village to join a little-used ancient track to Futago-ji, the principal temple on Kunisaki. After lunch at a local restaurant, a minibus picks us up to take us to our nearby lodgings for the night; another onsen. The lodgings here are dominated by the rare attraction of a giant, 25-inch reflecting telescope. Another sumptuous Japanese evening meal follows. Weather permitting; we will have the opportunity to look at the stars above Kunisaki through the telescope. The skies here are frequently very clear and a cloudless night can provide spectacular vistas of the heavens. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner provided. Total walking time: four hours. Total distance: approx. 4.3 miles.Day 6:\u00a0Baien-no-Sato - Kitsuki - Yufuin. Today we will visit Walk Japan\u2019s office and see the conservation projects they have initiated to support the community and protect the area. We visit the lovely Fuki-ji Temple, followed by the Kumano Magaibutsu, the little-known but largest Buddha relief carvings in Japan. Here we will enjoy a nicely prepared bento lunch. After lunch, we will take a look around Kitsuki, the quiet town's old samurai quarter, featuring buildings from feudal Edo Period Japan. En route to the spa resort town of Yufuin, we visit a sake brewery for a look around and a sample or two of the brewer\u2019s award-winning products. We spend the next two nights in a historic ryokan (traditional inn with thermal hot springs), in the center of Yufuin. This inn has been operated by one family for many generations; in a bygone era, it was frequented by the Japanese upper classes. Breakfast and dinner provided. Total walking time: three hours. Total distance: approx. 2.1 miles.Day 7:\u00a0Yufuin - Mt.Yufu - Yufuin. We have a choice today to either climb Mt. Yufu or relax in the pleasant surroundings of Yufuin, a charming resort town dominated by Mt. Yufu. For the hearty hikers, we take a minibus to the start of our 2,300-foot climb of Mt. Yufu (elevation 5,194 feet). At the mountain's peak, a grand panorama across Kyushu to an active volcano and Beppu Bay awaits us and makes a wondrous backdrop to a picnic lunch. After our walk, reinvigorating thermal hot spring baths are followed by another Japanese feast for dinner. Breakfast and dinner provided. Total walking time: six hours. Total distance: 6.2 miles. Total vertical ascent: 2,625 feet.Day 8:\u00a0Yufuin - Mt. Aso - Kagoshima. Today, we take the spectacular Yamanami Mountain Highway to the area that leads to the giant caldera of Mount Aso, Japan's largest active volcano. Our hike is dependent on the activity of the volcano and safety during our scheduled visit. The smell of sulfur is ever-present, and on some days, the volume of gas expelled by the volcano is so great that access to Mt. Naka's active crater and volcanic crater lake is restricted. After our selected hike we will be transported to Kumamoto. Here we board Japan\u2019s newest Shinkansen bullet train for Kagoshima, arriving mid-evening. Our hotel is near the station and tonight we\u2019ll take the opportunity to head into town and eat at an izakaya, a lively restaurant and local Japanese favorite. For those who wish, musical or not, there\u2019s an optional visit to another Japanese favorite, a karaoke bar. Breakfast and dinner provided. Total walking time: to be determined at arrival.Day 9:\u00a0Kagoshima - Mt. Kaimon - Ibusuki. Before leaving our hotel, we send our main luggage on to Yakushima for day ten, so we pack an overnight bag with enough for today and tomorrow\u2019s activities. With our overnight bag, we set off for Ibusuki and Mt. Kaimon. The latter is known as the \"Fuji of Satsuma\" because of its striking similarity to its famous counterpart. Satsuma was the original name of the Kagoshima region. We will be rewarded with great views back toward Kagoshima and Kirishima, as well as southwards to the island of Yakushima, our destination tomorrow, weather permiting. Covered with wildflowers during the warmer months, Mt. Kaimon also has historical significance. For many members of the Special Attack Corps, or Kamikaze Squadron, Mt. Kaimon was the last view of their homeland as they embarked on their fatal missions. After descending Mt. Kaimon, depending on time available, we may visit the acclaimed Peace Museum for Kamikaze Pilots in Chiran before making our way to our thermal hot spring lodgings in nearby Ibusuki. Ibusuki is a seaside town famed in Japan for its thermal sand baths. Breakfast and dinner are provided. Total walking time: four and a half hours. Total vertical ascent: approximately. 1,312 feet.Day 10:\u00a0Ibusuki - Yakushima. After breakfast, it is a short distance from our lodgings to the port in Ibusuki, where we catch an early morning, high-speed jetfoil to Yakushima Island. On arrival, we head straight for Shiratani Unsuikyo, a spectacular gorge that provides the backdrop for today's walking. This will be our first taste of Yakushima, a truly spectacular natural environment with climatic zones ranging from sub-tropical around the coast to frigid temperatures atop the island's highest peaks. Not surprisingly, a huge variety of flora and fauna find their homes here. Yakushima is officially one of the wettest places on earth, with upwards of 4,000 mm (13 feet) of rainfall recorded annually. Rain should not impair our enjoyment of our time here, but weatherproof gear is highly recommended. The rain actually adds greater atmosphere to the primeval forest we walk through. The forest includes giant, moss-covered cedars which are among some of the oldest trees in the world. We are guaranteed close encounters with deer and monkeys. Hayao Miyazaki, the Oscar-winning animator, found inspiration here for the scenery in Princess Mononoke, one of his most celebrated films. Weather and energy permitting, we'll take the trail as far as Taikoiwa, a giant viewing rock offering excellent views of the island's interior and high peaks, before descending to our lodgings for the evening. Breakfast and dinner provided. Total walking time: five hours. Total ascent: approximately 1,968 feet.Day 11:\u00a0Yakushima. Today's plans will be largely weather dependent, but a fine day will see us attempting an ascent of Mt. Kuromi Dake, a granite peak of 6,007 feet. This will necessitate an early start, but keep your eyes open as we take the winding mountain road up from the port of Anbo -- it's worth it for the views back toward the coast. The well-maintained trail to the top passes through a variety of cedar forest, high moorland, and grassland. Depending on the weather and cloud level, a number of alternative options are possible. These include an ascent of Mt. Mocchomu-dake via a viewpoint overlooking the spectacular Senpironotaki Falls; and a hike in Yakusugi Land, another area of impressive giant cedars and fast-flowing rivers. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner provided. Total walking time: around six to eight hours. Total ascent: approximately 2,625 feet.Day 12:\u00a0Yakushima \u2013 Kirishima. Following breakfast, we take the first flight back from Yakushima to Kagoshima. While our luggage goes on to our accommodation, we head for the mountains of Kirishima. We start on the Lake Onami path and 40 minutes later arrive at the lake. Lying 4,242 feet above sea level, it's the largest crater lake at this altitude in Japan. It is a good point to stop for a rest and take in the expansive views. According to legend, a dragon resides in the lake and at one point took the form of a beautiful maiden, living amongst local villagers for a while before returning to its home beneath the waters. We continue around the lake taking in good views of neighboring Mount Takachiho and the surrounding national park if the weather is clear. Our bus will take us back to Kirishima Jingu and our lodgings. Breakfast and dinner provided. Total walking time: five to six hours. Total vertical:\u00a02,133\u00a0feet.Day 13:\u00a0Kirishima - Kagoshima Airport. After breakfast we bid farewell and transfer to Kagoshima Airport, where the tour concludes.

In the 1970s, the World Wildlife Fund\u00a0launched its \"Operazione San Francesco\" to save the very last wolves in\u00a0the country, a tribute to St. Francis's love of and devotion to nature. During\u00a0our tour of Assisi we will see the treasures that adorn St. Francis' basilica,\u00a0including the tomb of the saint and Giotto's frescoes. We will enjoy the\u00a0evocative atmosphere of Assisi's roads and piazzas, and a panoramic view\u00a0of the Umbrian plains. Hiking distance:\u00a02 miles, +1,500 feet, -350 feet.Day 8:\u00a0Today we will walk the trail of Monte Ingino into town through the prettiest unspoiled countryside\u00a0in Umbria. The trail winds through a forested canyon and past a small\u00a0stone shrine and chapel that in 2016 were used in filming a movie about\u00a0St. Francis. We\u00a0follow a stream through a rocky area of exposed (calcare) limestone. At the\u00a0end of the hike, it's possible to enjoy time on your own at the unique\u00a0Gubbio shops in the afternoon. Hiking distance: 3 miles, +1,600 feet, -700 feet.Day 9:\u00a0We will drive by bus to the beautiful hill town of Spello, where we\u00a0will see incredible frescoes and walk through the cobblestone streets. We\u00a0will then go to La Spella church, on top of a hill, to start a very scenic walk\u00a0on the hillsides of Monte Subasio, the mountain of St. Francis. On our way\u00a0back to Gubbio, we will stop at Santa Maria delgi Angeli, a pilgrimage site,\u00a0where a tiny church sits within a large cathedral, all dedicated to St.\u00a0Francis. Hiking distance:\u00a03 miles, +400 feet, -1,200 feet.Day 10:\u00a0Today we explore a mystical abbey and one of the most important\u00a0monasteries in Italy. Surrounded by chestnut trees and wildlife diversity, the\u00a0Fonte Avellana was an important learning center at the time of St. Francis.\u00a0It is regarded today as the place where \"history was remembered\" by\u00a0monks who worked long hours transcribing ancient documents. Hiking\u00a0distance:\u00a05.5 miles, +\/- 1,800 feet.Day\u00a011:\u00a0Moving from Umbria to Tuscany, the region of Italy that's most\u00a0familiar to Americans, we will visit Trasimeno Lake, part of Trasimeno Park,\u00a0which is also home to the Oasi Naturalistica La Valle, a bird sanctuary and\u00a0environmental research center. We will also visit what is arguably the best olive oil production\u00a0center in Italy. After tasting here, you will never think the same way about\u00a0olive oil again.\u00a0After leaving the lake, we continue to Cortona, the town made famous by \u201cUnder the Tuscan Sun.\u201d Here we have time for a short walking tour of this charming town.\u00a0Tonight we will sleep in a small hotel.\u00a0Day 12:\u00a0Today we will walk the Franciscan Trail to La Verna, the other\u00a0famous Franciscan center of Italy.

There are too many to name, but as our safari\u00a0progresses, it should be easy to identify at least a hundred.Days 7-8: Our crew will move ahead to set up the next camp in the Savuti area of Chobe National Park while we spend our time\u00a0enjoying the animals and birds with no camp chores to worry about. What makes safari\u00a0so fascinating is taking the time to observe the animal behavior and interaction. We'll see different\u00a0animals in the floodplains of Savuti. In addition to those named in the first three days, there are\u00a0sitatunga, crocodile, hippo, and otter. Birds of the wetlands include different storks,\u00a0flamingos, bee-eaters, hornbills, and various geese, along with predators such as eagles,\u00a0hawks, vultures, owls, and others. This area has over 350 bird species and the most interesting human history in the region. Around the evening campfire, our guides will tell\u00a0these stories as well as answer our questions about the animal behaviors we have\u00a0observed during the day.\u00a0Days 9-10: We'll move farther north to the waterfront of Chobe National Park. This park, which borders Namibia, Zambia, and Zimbabwe, is a good bit larger than Connecticut. It\u00a0encompasses a wide variety of terrain, from a lush river region in the north (where\u00a0myriad game come to drink) and unremitting dry bushland in the south. Chobe is famous\u00a0for its herds of elephants. They tramp around everywhere -- 45,000 are said to make\u00a0Chobe their home. Watching elephants is fascinating, and one cannot help but admire\u00a0these huge, intelligent beasts. Nowhere in Africa can elephants be seen in such numbers\u00a0as in Chobe. In addition to game drives, we take an afternoon river cruise on\u00a0the Chobe River to view animals as they come down to drink before sunset. The light at\u00a0this time of day is incredible! Of course, this is also the kingdom of the big cats and\u00a0hippos, as well as many species of antelope.\u00a0Days 11-12: After bidding good-bye to our safari guides, we\u2019ll cross the\u00a0Zimbabwe border and drive through Zambezi National Park to Victoria Falls. The falls, which\u00a0are known as The Smoke That Thunders, are a world-famous sight. With a 350-foot drop\u00a0and mile-plus width producing a massive sheet of falling water, they are the largest falls in the world and one of the Seven Natural Wonders of the world -- a real sight to behold!

It is teeming with wildlife, drifting pack ice, and remarkable tundra plants. The Arctic touches eight countries and also includes indigenous people and cultures. The polar biodiversity is extraordinary and, of course, well-known for the amazing life and adaptation of the polar bear.The names Spitsbergen and Svarlbad are often used interchangeably in books and articles, just to make things confusing! The Arctic archipelago of Svalbard is a place where the summer\u2019s midnight sun mirrors its torchlight off glaciers. Spitsbergen is the largest island in this archipelago. One of the last great wildernesses on earth, these areas are home to countless birds, seals, arctic fox, reindeer, walrus, whales, and\u00a0the king of the arctic: the polar bear--EXPANDFROMHERE--. With our expedition vessel the focus of our trip will be comfortable, exploratory arctic travel. We will spend as much time ashore as possible, combined with educational lectures on board, covering topics such as bird life, marine mammals, vegetation, and landscapes. We will have inflatable Zodiacs in which we can cruise among ice floes and search for whales, seals, and walruses. You will be fascinated by the pure wildness of a place with so much life, color, peace, and emotion.Spitsbergen is the northernmost permanently inhabited area of the world. Approximately 60% of the Svalbard archipelago is covered by glacier, some seemingly starting at the very top of sharp peaks rising to more than 5,000 feet. Vegetation covers only 6-7% of the land with the most fertile areas found in the inner fjord regions. All of the area is covered by permafrost, with only the top meter of earth thawing in the summer. Even in this hostile environment, small plants are able to survive; over 170 have been identified.Wildlife here is abundant and varied. Polar bear, arctic fox, Svalbard reindeer, bearded seal, common harbor seal, walrus, and several whales make their home on and around Svalbard. The reindeer here are smaller than their mainland relatives and do not form large herds. The islands are home to a variety of flora: in addition to the typical tundra vegetation of mosses and lichens, there are also 250 species of fungi, 7 species of ferns, and 164 flowering plants.Some of the largest concentrations of birds in the North Atlantic region can be found here; up to several hundred thousand birds. Dominant species include the little auk, kittiwake, and fulmar, with other species such as Brunnich\u2019s goose, Arctic skua, long-tailed duck, red-throated diver, barnacle goose, rock ptarmigan, both common and king eider, and purple sandpiper. While approximately 30 species nest in the Svalbard archipelago, the Svalbard ptarmigan is the only bird species that stays on here throughout winter. While this outing will not be conducted with a \u201cbirder\u2019s only\u201d focus, we will be able to observe many bird species and will marvel at the variety. Birders are welcome and it is likely that everyone, including non-birders, will start looking at and enjoying the rich avian life.Some three thousand Norwegians and Russians live here in three permanent settlements, working mostly in research institutes or the coal-mining industry. The area outside the settlements of Spitsbergen and the Svalbard archipelago is still pure wilderness; vast parts being protected as nature reserves. Despite the northern position of the islands (76-81\u00b0 N), the climate is relatively mild due to the influence of the Atlantic Gulf Stream. During our trip the summer temperatures will range from 32-50\u00b0 F. Occasionally there will be rain and fog, but many days will have sunshine -- and many nights as well, due to the midnight sun. Temperatures will be fairly consistent from day to night. Winds can be variable in direction and force. This area may be described as an \u201cArctic desert,\u201d with annual rain and snowfall a mere 7-11 inches.Since 1700, Spitsbergen has been the goal or departure point for many expeditions, both scientific and exploratory. Some of the most famous are the Andr\u00e9e Balloon Expedition, Amundsen\u2019s venture with the airship \u201cNorge,\u201d and Mobile\u2019s with the airship \u201cItalia.\" The presence of coal was known relatively early to hunters and whalers who visited the Svalbard archipelago and they used it for heating. Interest in its financial potential did not arise until the end of the 19th\u00a0century.This cruise is much more than a sightseeing jaunt; it is truly an educational and exploratory adventure. A variety of optional activities, all of which are already included in the trip cost (Zodiac cruising, snowshoeing, and hiking), provide a unique opportunity for Arctic travelers seeking adventure.\u00a0 Bring a good camera and join us for a unique trip of a lifetime!","highlights":"Search for polar bear, walrus, reindeer, and arctic fox, Experience the Arctic by cruise, foot, and snowshoe, Learn from scientists and on-board naturalists","includes":"  Comfortable twin cabins with private bath and shower,   Delicious international cuisine and attentive crew,   Zodiac cruising, photography, hiking, and snowshoeing","itinerary":"While the following is the intended itinerary, all stated programs are subject to change, depending on a variety of factors including weather, land and sea conditions, and sailing schedules. Day 1: The trip officially begins in Longyearbyen. Longyearbyen is the main settlement of Spitsbergen on the Svalbard archipelago, which was originally established as a coal-mining settlement more than 100 years ago. There are approximately 2,000 inhabitants in town. We will visit the Svalbard Museum, which has interesting exhibits on the history of Svalbard, the mining industry, and polar exploration prior to our departure on the MV Hondius. After stowing our gear in our cabins on the ship, we will watch from the decks as we sail on our way to the land of ice, snow, polar bears, glaciers, walrus, and more.Day 2: This morning we sail to Raudfiord, a beautiful fjord area on Spitsbergen\u2019s northern coast. Due to the geologic diversity, there are a variety of sandstones, conglomerates, and marbles, with an abundance of reddish soil. Because of the influence of the Gulf Stream, the tundra is very lush here and we will also see a variety of birds such as Arctic terns, common eider, and kittiwakes. We may be able to take a hike on this fragile landscape to have a closer look, walking amongst the saxifrage and Arctic poppies.Day 3: Today we sail to Liefdefjorden, which translates as the \u201clove fjord!\u201d This is a stunningly beautiful place and also a good place to look for polar bears. We will also see the immense Monaco glaciers as well as calving glaciers and ice in all shapes, forms, and sizes. We might be lucky to see a fin whale. If time permits we will visit Moffen Island to look for walruses, which usually frequent this beautiful island.Day 4: Today we sail to Hinlopen Strait. This is the strait between Spitsbergen and Nordaustlandet in Svalbard, Norway. It is 150\u00a0kilometers long, 10\u201360\u00a0kilometers wide, and relatively shallow. The strait is an interesting travel objective because of pack ice, which can be easy or challenging depending on the day. By sky, land, and sea, we will look for local inhabitants such as giant reindeer, polar bears, and even a few walruses along the pack ice. Birds we might see and hear include the Brunichs guillemots and the large Glaucous gulls.Day 5: Today we sail to the barren and rocky Seven Islands, the northern part of the Svalbard archipelago. It is the northernmost land of Europe. The names of the individual islands tell quite a bit about the history. Phipps\u00f8ya was named after the Englishman Phipps, who was in the area in 1773 during an attempt to reach the North Pole, as was Parry in 1827, after whom another island --\u00a0Parry\u00f8ya --\u00a0is named. Ice conditions are often difficult, so we should have more interesting travel here. This is considered high-arctic environment, which is very barren with little vegetation. There are mostly lichens and mosses, which can be quite colorful and, in places, Svalbard Poppy and saxifrages. We should see colonies of seabirds, including puffins and ivory gulls. Herds of walrus are sometimes ashore, and polar bears are often around.Day 6: Today we retrace our route westward, enjoying the landscape and solitude, looking for polar bear, walrus, birds, and ice, or just taking in the vastness.Day 7: Today we sail to Prins Karls Forland, an island off the west coast of Spitsbergen. The entire island and the surrounding sea area constitutes Forlandet National Park.This area consists of partly alpine mountains with very pointed peaks and wild glaciers, which are very spectacular and remind one of the Antarctic Peninsula. There are rock glaciers, old beach ridge series, and frost-patterned ground, which we shall see. Large numbers of Brunich\u2019s guillemots, kittywakes, and Glaucous gulls are breeding on the steep cliffs. Reindeer and foxes are seen on the tundra and a harbor seal colony can be seen on the shore; the only one in Svalbard. Walrus, too; this is still the only area with haul-out sites on the west coast. The process of re-establishing old population numbers has still just started.\u00a0Whalers and trappers have used the island and left their traces, which we should be able to observe from the boat or on shore.Day 8: Today we arrive in Longyearbyen, reflecting on our incredible voyage.","leader1":"Kath Giel","leader2":"","leader3":""}},{"trip":{"title":"Hiking Through Time Along Hadrian's Wall, England","id":"19655A","dates":"Jun 17, 2019 to Jul 1, 2019","destination":"Europe, Great Britain, England","type":"International","group":"","difficulty":"","priceHigh":"4645","priceLow":"4145","image":{"src":"https:\/\/content.sierraclub.org\/outings\/sites\/content.sierraclub.org.outings\/files\/styles\/trip-teaser\/public\/trips\/main-images\/19655_8_MelindaGoodwater.jpg?itok=DQNWeiyi","alt":"Hiking Through Time Along Hadrian's Wall, England"},"path":"\/outings\/hiking-time-hadrians-wall-england#trip=19655A","overview":"The TripTwo thousand years ago, Celts, Picts, and Scots inhabited the British Isles. In AD43, the Romans came to expand their empire north to the present day Scottish border. A string of forts were built across the narrowest section of northern England from the River Tyne in the east to Solway Firth in the west. Emperor Hadrian arrived at this northernmost frontier in AD122 with the inspired idea to build a wall from coast to coast to intimidate the barbarian Picts and Scots and to collect tariffs and taxes from those who would cross it. Such a monumental project had never been attempted and to this day it stands as the largest, most significant remains of what the Roman Empire once was.In six years a massive 10-foot-wide wall (later reduced to 8 feet) of undetermined height was built 84 miles across the country. It connected 14 forts on or just off the course of the wall with a milecastle built at every mile and two turrets 1\/3 mile apart in between. Nearby sandstone quarries were used to meticulously square-up the stones to perfectly fit together thus creating a wall with major sections still standing today. So important is this monument that the entire route of it is a UNESCO World Heritage site and a National Trail was built alongside it.This trip traces Hadrian's Wall and its history from the North Sea coastal city of Newcastle-upon-Tyne west to the sanctuary wetlands of Bowness-on-Solway off the Irish Sea. Beginning in Newcastle, we'll start off visiting ruins of forts protecting the mouth of the River Tyne where men and supplies were brought in and where the Wall actually started. Much of the city has been built on top of the Wall so the Wall Path follows the scenic river walk of the Tyne through historic shipyards, defunct coal works, and modern cosmopolitan architecture. We'll learn how the city has changed and developed since Roman times. Leaving the city behind, preserved sections of Wall stand out. As we get into the rolling hills of farms and pastures, we'll notice depressions of the vallum -- the large, wide ditch built parallel and south of the Wall for added protection. Soon we come upon fort ruins, museums housing their discoveries, and increasingly longer sections of Wall. These are best preserved in the rugged interior, crossing the harsh geography of the Pennines. A product of tectonic plates colliding, the Wall climbs like a snake above the sheer escarpment of the Whin Sills and Winshield Crags. On these high points views open up to Scotland and current archaeological digs still uncover Roman artifacts. We'll take the time to visit these well-preserved ruins and museums to learn about the history of the Wall and the lives of soldiers and centurions who lived along it. Descending to the west into rolling farmland, the Wall is once again under our feet as we make our way to the city of Carlisle, a settlement inhabited for 2,000 years. After visiting its castle, museum, and cathedral, we finish along the wetlands of Solway Firth to Bowness-on-Solway, an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, bird sanctuary, and the end of the Wall.This multi-dimensional adventure combines challenging hiking through a diversity of landscapes, learning about the 2,000-year-old history of the area, and immersing ourselves in local culture by staying in small hotels and inns along the way. Hike with only a day pack as our luggage is transported to our lodgings each day. Fine meals of local cuisine round out the experience. If you've ever wondered what life was like in Roman times, join this outing and find out!","highlights":"Walk the entire 84-mile Hadrian's Wall Path, Visit Roman fort ruins, archaeological sites, museums, See a diversity of landscapes from coast to coast","includes":"  All meals and accommodations,   Luggage transfer every day,   Admissions at all museums and historical sites","itinerary":"Day 1: Arrive in Newcastle, then meet at our hotel. Arrive by 5:00 p.m. for our trip orientation before dinner, the first trip meal.Day 2: Begin with a 6-mile flat walk to South Shields at the mouth of the River Tyne for the ceremonial toe-dipping in the North Sea. Visit Arbeia Roman Fort, which protected the coast and river mouth for transport of materials and men to construct the Wall. Public transport back to our hotel.Day 3: Start at Segedunum Roman Fort at the beginning of the Wall. A visit to the museum and reconstructed Roman bathhouse immerses us into life in the second century. We'll also be able to see the true beginning of the original Wall. Hadrian's Wall Path National Trail follows the River Tyne river walk 11.5 flat miles past old shipyards and defunct coal works, sophisticated cosmopolitan architecture, business centers of Newcastle, through suburbs into the outlying town of Newburn for the night. The National Trail does not follow the line of the Wall through Newcastle as the city's been built on top of it and the scenic river walk offers a history of the city.\u00a0\u00a0Day 4: With the city behind us, we continue walking above the river to see long sections of exposed Wall at Heddon-on-Wall. Passing into pastoral rolling farmland, we\u2019ll walk adjacent to the old military road that connected the forts and then divert around an old farmhouse to the site of Vindobala Roman Fort site and Mithraic Temple. Imagine a time when this would have been teeming with soldiers. Some of the Wall stones have been repurposed into a substantial barn and can also be seen in the road embankment. Overnight at East Wallhouses in 9.5 miles.Day 5: This section of the trail features walking along the vallum, the wide ditch built parallel and south of the Wall still in evidence today. It then continues to weave itself along the ditch built north of the Wall. As we hike, the path\u2019s undulations become more pronounced as we approach Halton Chesters, site of Onnum Roman Fort and now home to grazing sheep. We continue on, passing the historic church of St. Oswald to Brunton Turret 26B, a fine example of turret and Wall. These turrets are built every third of a mile between milecastles. Today\u2019s last leg is to cross the River Tyne to finish in Chollerford in 9 miles.Day 6: Just beyond Chollerford we visit Chesters Roman Fort, an excellent excavation highlighting the extensive Roman bathhouse. Learn about John Clayton and how he saved the Wall in the 19th century at his museum featuring Roman carved stones and other artifacts of the era. Walk along many long sections of Wall, including milecastles, turrets, and religious sites as the landscape gets more hilly and rugged arriving at Housesteads in 10 miles. We stay here for two nights.\u00a0Day 7: A layover day here gives us time to explore the extensive ruins of the best excavated fort of the Wall at Housesteads during the morning. Revealing officer\u2019s quarters, soldier\u2019s barracks, a granary, and even the sophisticated Roman latrine, a docent will explain the significance of all these features. In the afternoon we'll take the AD122 bus to Vindolanda, another extensive fort excavation, including the vicus -- the civilian village adjacent to the fort to serve the soldiers' needs. This is a current excavation site where new discoveries are being made. Roman tablets from the 2nd century have been found here of soldiers' letters, shopping lists, etc. See copies of these in the excellent museum. Return to Housesteads for the night.Day 8: Continue over the most remote and rugged part of the Wall. It climbs over the steep hills of the Pennines atop the sheer escarpment of the Whin Sill and Winshield Crags, cliffs left from tectonic crashing of two plates. Views stretch to Scotland from these high points passing Crag Lough (lake) and iconic Sycamore Gap with its lone sycamore tree. We\u2019ll take a break in Carvoran at the Roman Army Museum and view a short film on a year in the life of a soldier stationed on the Wall. We then pass Thirlwall Castle en route to Gilsland in 10 miles.\u00a0Day 9: We\u2019ll see the original abutments of the Roman bridge over the River Irthing on the way to Birdoswald, last of the well-preserved fort ruins. Pass more milecastles and turrets along Wall sections while dropping into the rolling hills of Lanercost, our stop for the night, in 6.5 miles. Visit the 12th century priory built of pilfered Wall stones, which was residence of King Edward I for 6 months in 1306. The king was debilitated at the time and ruled England from here.\u00a0Day 10: We climb gradually back up to the Wall Path and follow rolling hills as the Wall once again is buried below us. A final section of exposed Wall is beyond the Dovecote Bridge -- from there the Wall was turf and little survives. Walking through farms and pastureland, the vallum and Wall ditch are clearly visible undulations. Flowering fields and quaint villages highlight the pastoral beauty as we reach Crosby-on-Eden for the night in 8 miles.\u00a0Days 11-12: An easy 5-mile walk brings us into the city of Carlisle. The afternoon is free for individual pursuits such as laundry, reading, or exploring this historic city. We spend two nights here with a layover day to check out Carlisle Castle, the most besieged fortification in England; the Tullie House Museum, built on top of the original Roman fort with its Roman Gallery showcasing relics of the city's 2,000-year history; and Carlisle Cathedral, an architectural wonder influenced by both its Scottish and English ownership. Carlisle is very close to the Scottish border and steeped in history as the castle dungeons were used for Scottish Jacobite rebels in the 18th century and Mary Queen of Scots was held captive in the watch tower in the 16th century.\u00a0Days 13-14: We leave Carlisle through a scenic rural farming area with fields ablaze with flowers and nearly forgotten hamlets, arriving at Burgh-by-Sands in 6 miles. Visit historic St. Michael's Church, built on the site of Aballava Roman Fort in the 13th century with blocks of stone from the Wall. King Edward I died near here and laid in state in the church until transferred to Westminster Abbey. We finish the last flat 9 miles to the shore of Solway Firth along the wetlands of Bowness-on-Solway, protected as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty renowned for its birds and botanical diversity. Our walk ends at the Path Pavilion where we dip our toes in the Irish Sea. We\u2019ll celebrate our accomplishment with a pint at the Kings Arms, overnight in Bowness.Day 15: The trip ends after breakfast with a morning hour-long bus ride back to Carlisle, arriving around noon. Drop-off is at the main Carlisle bus station, an easy walk to the Citadel train station for onward travel.","leader1":"Melinda Goodwater","leader2":"","leader3":""}},{"trip":{"title":"Hiking the Alps of Bavaria and Tyrol, Germany and Austria","id":"19660A","dates":"Jun 18, 2019 to Jun 29, 2019","destination":"Europe, Germany","type":"International","group":"","difficulty":"","priceHigh":"3945","priceLow":"3945","image":{"src":"https:\/\/content.sierraclub.org\/outings\/sites\/content.sierraclub.org.outings\/files\/styles\/trip-teaser\/public\/trips\/main-images\/17640_1_StevenVeit.jpg?itok=0tKDQMnx","alt":"Hiking the Alps of Bavaria and Tyrol, Germany and Austria"},"path":"\/outings\/hiking-alps-bavaria-tyrol-germany-austria#trip=19660A","overview":"The TripThe German and Austrian Alps feature pristine lakes and rivers, high mountains, green pastures, and thundering river gorges.

We'll visit King Ludwig II's fantasy castle, cruise on fjord-like Lake K\u00f6nigssee, and take walking tours of local historical and cultural sites.\u00a0","highlights":"Hike alpine mountain trails during wildflower season, Visit famous castles, churches, and Munich and Salzburg, Enjoy a Mozart dinner concert and local folk music","includes":"  Most meals, comfortable lodging, and a private coach,   All activity and entrance fees,   Relaxing electric boat cruise on serene Lake K\u00f6nigssee","itinerary":"Please note that the itinerary is subject to change should weather or participant safety issues arise.Day 1:\u00a0We'll meet at a centrally located hotel in Munich at 8:30 a.m., then travel in our comfortable, air-conditioned bus to beautiful Berchtesgaden, located at the foot of impressive Mt. Watzmann. After arriving at our hotel, we'll take a guided walking tour of Berchtesgaden\u2019s well-preserved town center, including the castle square and medieval marketplace--EXPANDFROMHERE--. Overnight: Berchtesgaden.Day 2:\u00a0Today will begin at Lake K\u00f6nigssee in Berchtesgaden National Park. Our electric boat will glide silently past sheer mountain walls and emerald green forests before stopping on a small peninsula at the foot of Mt. Watzmann's impressive east face. We'll hear a talk about the history and management of this remarkable park, and then hike for a couple of hours in the forest behind photogenic St. Bartholomew's Church. After lunch we'll re-board the boat and continue on to Salet, at the far end of the lake. A short trail leads to Lake Obersee, one of the most beautiful places on earth. We'll continue hiking on an up-and-down lakeside trail to an idyllic mountain pasture and hut, where we'll stop to rest. Cold beverages are available at the hut, perhaps the only such spot in Bavaria where very locally sourced buttermilk is a more popular choice than beer. Overnight: Berchtesgaden.Day 3:\u00a0We'll begin today's hike at Maria Gern Pilgrimage Church, often described as the loveliest church in Berchtesgadener Land. Our trail leads up to the Ettenberg plateau, where we'll enjoy panoramic views of the region before continuing down through the Almbachklamm, a deeply cut chasm with rock overhangs, thunderous waterfalls, and clear pools. The hike concludes at the Kugelmuehle, Germany's last remaining marble grinding mill. In the evening we will take a short bus ride into Austria to attend a dinner concert at Salzburg's 806 C.E. Peterskeller, where Charlemagne is said to have dined. Selections of Mozart's works will be performed in an elegant Baroque dining room. Overnight: Berchtesgaden.\u00a0Day 4:\u00a0Today is a cultural-historic tour day. Following breakfast at our hotel, we\u2019ll depart for a walking tour of historic Salzburg. Our guided tour will include information on the filming of The Sound of Music. There will be free time to visit the Mozart Museum, the Mirabell Gardens and palace, or the old city fortress. Chocolate lovers may prefer to stop by the Sacher Hotel to sample the famous Austrian torte. Re-boarding our bus, we\u2019ll return to the Berchtesgaden area, riding up the mountain to our tour of Dokumentation Obersalzberg. This museum offers an intelligently presented, sobering consideration of the causes and consequences of Nazism. Then we\u2019ll explore the fascinating and bizarre network of fortified command bunkers carved into the mountainside by the Third Reich, concluding our tour with an unforgettable elevator ride up to the historic mountaintop Eagle's Nest. Tonight we'll conclude our day of cultural and historical contrasts, enjoying a special dinner with folk music. Overnight: Berchtesgaden.Day 5:\u00a0This morning we leave Berchtesgaden for Mittenwald. We\u2019ll take the Karwendelbahn gondola up to the top station, where our alpine loop hike will begin. If the weather's clear, we can expect far-reaching views over Mittenwald and the Karwendel range.\u00a0 Mittenwald is a particularly attractive Bavarian town, noted for its ornately hand-painted shops, homes, and churches. It\u2019s also the center of German violin making, proudly on display at the Geigenbau Museum. After leaving Mittenwald we travel a short distance across the Austrian border into the province of Tyrol to our cozy hotel in the village of Seefeld. Overnight: Seefeld.Day 6:\u00a0After breakfast, we will depart for a pleasant daylong loop hike. We\u2019ll have a brief tour through the town as we head up to the trails. Our first stop will be Wildmoosalm, a beautiful meadow surrounded by forest and peaks. Along the way we will identify wildflowers and maybe even see some chickadees. We continue on our gentle path to Lottensee H\u00fctte, a beautiful alpine hut located on the shores of a seasonal lake. We continue in the forest, taking a short uphill trail to another lake, and then back to town. We will pass ski jumps used in the winter Olympics and may see a number of Austrians training on their roller skis. Back in town we\u2019ll have time to relax and maybe enjoy a sauna before the sun sets. Overnight: Seefeld.Day 7:\u00a0Today we have a daylong hike that covers varied terrain and culminates in a glorious mountain summit. Seefeld sits on a sunny plateau that's cooled by mountain breezes and rimmed by rocky crests. The Tyrolean Wetterstein and Karwendel mountain ranges form dramatic backdrops to the north and east. We\u2019ll begin with a ride on a funicular train up to the Rossh\u00fctte, where we\u2019ll board a cable car and ride to the top station at 6,725 feet. Next we\u2019ll hike uphill for approximately an hour to reach the summit of the Reither Spitze (elevation 7,635 feet) for spectacular views of the region. Finally, we\u2019ll wind our way down to N\u00f6rdlinger Hutte for lunch and perhaps some yodeling practice before we head down the mountain and back to our hotel. Depending on the weather conditions and time, we may opt to shorten the hike by taking advantage of a cable car connection that traverses back over to the Rossh\u00fctte for a quicker return to Seefeld. Overnight: Seefeld.Day 8:\u00a0Following breakfast, we\u2019ll take a short drive to Garmisch-Partenkirchen, a winter sports mecca and home to Germany\u2019s highest mountain, the Zugspitze. We will hike just above the torrent rushing through narrow Partnachklamm gorge, walking on a pathway cut into the side of the canyon wall. Hiking up out of the gorge, we\u2019ll cross back over the top of the gorge on the \u201cIron Bridge\u201d before coming to a pleasant stop for lunch. In the afternoon, we\u2019ll continue on to F\u00fcssen, the southern terminus of the famous Romantic Road. Along the way we'll stop to tour King Ludwig II's beautiful Linderhof Palace and walk in the elegant gardens, modeled after Versailles. We'll also tour the Venus Grotto, constructed by King Ludwig II as a private theater where he could listen as his friend Richard Wagner conducted his operas. The main chamber contains an artificial lake, complete with a shell-shaped, gilded boat. Continuing our journey, we\u2019ll make a brief stop at the gloriously decorated Wieskirche or \"Church in the Meadow,\" a UNESCO World Heritage site regarded as the world\u2019s best example of late rococo church architecture.\u00a0 Arriving in F\u00fcssen, we\u2019ll check into our interesting, antique-filled hotel near the River Lech. Overnight: F\u00fcssen.Day 9:\u00a0This morning we\u2019ll ride over to Hohenschwangau, where we\u2019ll begin our day\u2019s adventure by walking up the carriage road 30 minutes to Ludwig\u2019s fantasy castle of Neuschwanstein, everyone\u2019s (including Disney\u2019s) archetype for a medieval castle. After a tour of this totally over-the-top dream home, we\u2019ll head up the short path to the Marienbr\u00fccke (Mary's Bridge), which spans the ravine above Neuschwanstein for an unforgettable castle view. Leaving the crowds behind and continuing our hike, we\u2019ll walk for about three miles, gaining 2,300 feet to arrive at the Tegelberg viewpoint, where we\u2019ll stop for refreshment at this mountain restaurant. Weather permitting, we\u2019ll see hang gliders and paragliders launch from this mountaintop site, before we ride the cable gondola down to Hohenschwangau and take the bus back to our hotel. Overnight: F\u00fcssen.Day 10:\u00a0After breakfast, we\u2019ll take a short bus ride back across the border to Reutte, Austria where we\u2019ll hike up to the lonely ruins of 13th\u00a0CE Ehrenberg Castle, an interesting contrast to the much-visited Neuschwanstein. After our castle walk, we\u2019ll head back towards F\u00fcssen, stopping for lunch at a lakeside inn. Our free afternoon in F\u00fcssen offers an opportunity for some shopping in the pedestrian-only town center, a walk up to the Hohes Schloss (High Castle), or perhaps just time to relax. Overnight:\u00a0F\u00fcssen.Day 11:\u00a0We'll board our bus for the two-hour trip to Munich, leave our bags at the hotel, and then begin a guided bus and walking tour of the city. \u00a0After viewing the famous mechanical carillon in Marienplatz square, we\u2019ll walk over to the nearby Viktualienmarkt (a bustling outdoor food market). We\u2019ll choose from the many options available for our picnic table lunch. There will be free time for last-minute shopping before we return to our hotel to check in and have a short rest. Tonight we\u2019ll walk from our hotel to a festive farewell dinner at one of Munich's oldest restaurants.

These grand mountains are famous for their brilliant white color, vertical vistas, green valleys, and lush alpine meadows. During our 14 days together we\u2019ll experience this abundant beauty.The Dolomites are also famous for their contrasts: the geologic composition of the mountains includes both dolomitic and volcanic formations, and the cultural heritage of the area includes Italian and Tyrolean influences due to a boundary relocation at the end of World War I. In fact, each village or town has an Italian, German, and Ladin name. There are pockets in this area where the local language is Ladin, which originated from an ancient culture underlying the whole region.\u00a0\"I came away with an understanding of all aspects of the area; geological, cultural, environmental, and historical.\"\u00a0\u2014\u00a02014 participant","highlights":"Hike and explore breathtaking mountains and valleys, Spend nights in picturesque hotels and refugios, Savor delicious cuisine and beverages","includes":"  All meals except two lunches,   Lodging and gratuities,   On-trip transportation, including luggage transfer","itinerary":"Day 1: The group will meet at our hotel in Cortina at 5 p.m. After introductions, a trip summary, and a nice dinner, you are free to walk around this charming town before turning in for the night.

Archaeologists and forensic scientists continue to learn a great deal about primitive man by studying him and his tools, clothes, and the vegetable matter he was carrying. The cause of his death remains a mystery, although there are many opinions on how this occurred.\u00a0 We dine together for the last time tonight.Day 14: After breakfast this morning we check out of our hotel, to either return home or continue travels to other destinations.
